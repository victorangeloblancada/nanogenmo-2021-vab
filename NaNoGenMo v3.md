The teacher acknowledged the query with a nod.

The educator elaborated carefully, "Love encompasses a range of strong and positive emotional and mental states, from the most sublime virtue or good habit, the deepest interpersonal affection, to the simplest pleasure. An example of this range of meanings is that the love of a mother differs from the love of a spouse, which differs from the love of food. Most commonly, love refers to a feeling of a strong attraction and emotional attachment.Love is considered to be both positive and negative, with its virtue representing human kindness, compassion, and affection, as 'the unselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another' and its vice representing human moral flaw, akin to vanity, selfishness, amour-propre, and egotism, as potentially leading people into a type of mania, obsessiveness or codependency. It may also describe compassionate and affectionate actions towards other humans, one's self, or animals. In its various forms, love acts as a major facilitator of interpersonal relationships and, owing to its central psychological importance, is one of the most common themes in the creative arts. Love has been postulated to be a function that keeps human beings together against menaces and to facilitate the continuation of the species.Ancient Greek -"

Some of the country's 574 federally recognized tribes govern more than one reservation, while some share reservations, and others have no reservation at all. In addition, because of past land allotments, leading to sales to non–Native Americans, some reservations are severely fragmented, with each piece of tribal, individual, and privately held land being a separate enclave. This jumble of private and public real estate creates significant administrative, political and legal difficulties.The collective geographical area of all reservations is 56,200,000 acres (22,700,000 ha; 87,800 sq mi; 227,000 km2), approximately the size of the state of Idaho -"

The teacher seethed confidently, "-Equator. For other planets in the Solar System -"

"What's Solar System?" a boy raised excitedly.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The instructor sang politely, "A star system or stellar system is a small number of stars that orbit each other, bound by gravitational attraction. A large group of stars bound by gravitation is generally called a star cluster or galaxy, although, broadly speaking, they are also star systems. Star systems are not to be confused with planetary systems, which include planets and similar bodies (such as comets). A star system of two stars is known as a binary star, binary star system or physical double star. If there are no tidal effects, no perturbation from other forces, and no transfer of mass from one star to the other, such a system is stable, and both stars will trace out an elliptical orbit around the barycenter of the system indefinitely. (See Two-body problem -"

"What's Two-body problem?" a boy wondered pointedly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a nod.

The lecturer said happily, "In classical mechanics, the two-body problem is to predict the motion of two massive objects which are abstractly viewed as point particles. The problem assumes that the two objects interact only with one another; the only force affecting each object arises from the other one, and all other objects are ignored. The most prominent case of the classical two-body problem is the gravitational case (see also Kepler problem -"

The educator took a breath, waiting for a question from the class about Kepler problem or some other topic.

The educator proceeded.

The lecturer elaborated patiently, "-Kepler problem), arising in astronomy for predicting the orbits (or escapes from orbit) of objects such as satellites, planets, and stars. A two-point-particle model of such a system nearly always describes its behavior well enough to provide useful insights and predictions. A simpler 'one body' model, the 'central-force problem', treats one object as the immobile source of a force acting on other. One then seeks to predict the motion of the single remaining mobile object. Such an approximation can give useful results when one object is much more massive than the other (as with a light planet orbiting a heavy star, where the star can be treated as essentially stationary). However, the one-body approximation is usually unnecessary except as a stepping stone. For many forces, including gravitational ones, the general version of the two-body problem can be reduced to a pair of one-body problems, allowing it to be solved completely, and giving a solution simple enough to be used effectively. By contrast, the three-body problem (and, more generally, the n-body problem for n ≥ 3) cannot be solved in terms of first integrals, except in special cases. The two-body problem is interesting in astronomy because pairs of astronomical objects are often moving rapidly in arbitrary directions (so their motions become interesting), widely separated from one another (so they won't collide) and even more widely separated from other objects (so outside influences will be small enough to be ignored safely). Under the force of gravity, each member of a pair of such objects will orbit their mutual center of mass in an elliptical pattern, unless they are moving fast enough to escape one another entirely, in which case their paths will diverge along other planar conic sections. If one object is very much heavier than the other, it will move far less than the other with reference to the shared center of mass. The mutual center of mass may even be inside the larger object. For a mathematical summary of the solutions for this case, see Gravitational two-body problem -"

"What's Gravitational two-body problem?" a pupil piped up.

The professor paid no heed to the interruption and carried on.

"Well then, getting back to Star system....", the lecturer declared slowly.

The students suppressed giggles.

The instructor noted politely, "-Cretaceous (100.5–66 Ma) is the younger of two epochs into which the Cretaceous geological period is divided in the geologic time scale. Rock strata from this epoch form the Upper Cretaceous series. The Cretaceous is named after the white limestone known as chalk, which occurs widely in northern France and is seen in the white cliffs of south-eastern England, and which dates from this time. During the Late Cretaceous, the climate was warmer than present, although throughout the period a cooling trend is evident. The tropics became restricted to equatorial regions and northern latitudes experienced markedly more seasonal climatic conditions. Due to plate tectonics, the Americas were gradually moving westward, causing the Atlantic Ocean to expand. The Western Interior Seaway -"

The educator acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The educator declared gently, "Reptiles, as most commonly defined, are the animals in the class Reptilia , a paraphyletic grouping comprising all amniotes except synapsids (mammals and their extinct relatives) and Aves (birds). The class comprises turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. In the traditional Linnaean classification system, birds are considered a separate class to reptiles. However, crocodilians are more closely related to birds than they are to other living reptiles, and so modern cladistic classification systems include birds within Reptilia, redefining the term as a clade. Other cladistic definitions abandon the term reptile altogether in favor of the clade Sauropsida -"

The educator stopped, listening for a query from the class about Sauropsida or some other topic.

# Lesson 26: Domino (mathematics)

"Good morning, class! Today we'll be covering Domino (mathematics)," the educator elaborated calmly.

The students sat straighter in their seats.

The instructor announced mechanically, "In mathematics, a domino is a polyomino of order 2, that is, a polygon in the plane made of two equal-sized squares connected edge-to-edge. When rotations and reflections are not considered to be distinct shapes, there is only one free domino. Since it has reflection symmetry, it is also the only one-sided domino (with reflections considered distinct). When rotations are also considered distinct, there are two fixed dominoes: The second one can be created by rotating the one above by 90°.In a wider sense, the term domino is sometimes understood to mean a tile of any shape. Dominos can tile the plane in a countably infinite number of ways. The number of tilings of a 2×n rectangle with dominoes is F n {\displaystyle F_{n}} , the nth Fibonacci number.Domino tilings figure in several celebrated problems, including the Aztec diamond -"

"What's Aztec diamond?" a girl raised politely.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The lecturer said slowly, "In combinatorial mathematics, an Aztec diamond of order n consists of all squares of a square lattice whose centers (x,y) satisfy |x| + |y| ≤ n. Here n is a fixed integer, and the square lattice consists of unit squares with the origin as a vertex of 4 of them, so that both x and y are half-integers. The Aztec diamond theorem states that the number of domino tilings of the Aztec diamond of order n is 2n(n+1)/2. The Arctic Circle theorem says that a random tiling of a large Aztec diamond tends to be frozen outside a certain circle.It is common to color the tiles in the following fashion. First consider a checkerboard coloring of the diamond. Each tile will cover exactly one black square. Vertical tiles where the top square covers a black square, is colored in one color, and the other vertical tiles in a second. Similarly for horizontal tiles. Something that is very useful for counting tilings is looking at the non-intersecting paths through its corresponding directed graph. If we define our movements through a tiling (domino tiling) to be (1,1) when we are the bottom of a vertical tiling (1,0) where we are the end of a horizontal tiling (1,-1) when we are at the top of a vertical tilingThen through any tiling we can have these paths from our sources to our sinks. These movements are similar to Schröder paths. For example, consider an Aztec Diamond of order 2, and after drawing its directed graph we can label its sources and sinks. a 1 , a 2 {\displaystyle a_{1},a_{2}} are our sources and b 1 , b 2 {\displaystyle b_{1},b_{2}} are our sinks. On its directed graph, we can draw a path from a i {\displaystyle a_{i}} to b j {\displaystyle b_{j}} , this gives us a path matrix, P 2 {\displaystyle P_{2}} , P 2 = [ a 1 b 1 a 2 b 1 a 1 b 2 a 2 b 2 ] = [ 6 2 2 2 ] {\displaystyle P_{2}={\begin{bmatrix}a_{1}b_{1}&a_{2}b_{1}\\a_{1}b_{2}&a_{2}b_{2}\\\end{bmatrix}}={\begin{bmatrix}6&2\\2&2\\\end{bmatrix}}} where a i b j = {\displaystyle a_{i}b_{j}=} all the paths from a i {\displaystyle a_{i}} to b j {\displaystyle b_{j}} . The number of tilings for order 2 is det ( P 2 ) = 12 − 4 = 8 = 2 2 ( 2 + 1 ) / 2 {\displaystyle (P_{2})=12-4=8=2^{2(2+1)/2}} According to Lindstrom-Gessel-Viennot, if we let S be the set of all our sources and T be the set of all our sinks of our directed graph then det ( P n ) = {\displaystyle (P_{n})=} number of non-intersecting paths from S to T.Considering the directed graph of the Aztec Diamond, it has also been shown by Eu and Fu that Schröder paths and the tilings of the Aztec diamond are in bijection. Hence, finding the determinant of the path matrix, P n {\displaystyle P_{n}} , will give us the number of tilings for the Aztec Diamond of order n. Another way to determine the number of tilings of an Aztec Diamond is using Hankel matrices of large and small Schröder numbers, using the method from Lindstrom-Gessel-Viennot again. Finding the determinant of these matrices gives us the number of non-intersecting paths of small and large Schröder numbers, which is in bijection with the tilings. The small Schröder numbers are { 1 , 1 , 3 , 11 , 45 , ⋯ } = { y 0 , y 1 , y 2 , y 3 , y 4 , ⋯ } {\displaystyle \{1,1,3,11,45,\cdots \}=\{y_{0},y_{1},y_{2},y_{3},y_{4},\cdots \}} and the large Schröder numbers are { 1 , 2 , 6 , 22 , 90 , ⋯ } = { x 0 , x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , x 4 , ⋯ } {\displaystyle \{1,2,6,22,90,\cdots \}=\{x_{0},x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},x_{4},\cdots \}} , and in general our two Hankel matrices will be H n = [ x 1 x 2 ⋯ x n x 2 x 3 ⋯ x n + 1 ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ x n x n + 1 ⋯ x 2 n − 1 ] {\displaystyle H_{n}={\begin{bmatrix}x_{1}&x_{2}&\cdots &x_{n}\\x_{2}&x_{3}&\cdots &x_{n+1}\\\vdots &\vdots &&\vdots \\x_{n}&x_{n+1}&\cdots &x_{2n-1}\\\end{bmatrix}}} and G n = [ y 1 y 2 ⋯ y n y 2 y 3 ⋯ y n + 1 ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ y n y n + 1 ⋯ y 2 n − 1 ] {\displaystyle G_{n}={\begin{bmatrix}y_{1}&y_{2}&\cdots &y_{n}\\y_{2}&y_{3}&\cdots &y_{n+1}\\\vdots &\vdots &&\vdots \\y_{n}&y_{n+1}&\cdots &y_{2n-1}\\\end{bmatrix}}} where det ( H n ) = 2 2 ( n + 1 ) / 2 {\displaystyle (H_{n})=2^{2(n+1)/2}} and det ( G n ) = 2 2 ( n − 1 ) / 2 {\displaystyle (G_{n})=2^{2(n-1)/2}} where n ≥ 1 {\displaystyle n\geq 1} (It also true that det ( H n 0 ) = 2 2 ( n − 1 ) / 2 {\displaystyle (H_{n}^{0})=2^{2(n-1)/2}} where this is the Hankel matrix like H n {\displaystyle H_{n}} , but started with x 0 {\displaystyle x_{0}} instead of x 1 {\displaystyle x_{1}} for the first entry of the matrix in the top left corner). Consider the shape, 2 × n {\displaystyle 2\times n} block, and we can ask the same question as for the Aztec Diamond of order n. As this has been proven in many papers, we will refer to. Letting the 2 × n {\displaystyle 2\times n} block shape be denoted by B n {\displaystyle B_{n}} , then it can be seen The number of tilings of B n = F n {\displaystyle B_{n}=F_{n}} where F n {\displaystyle F_{n}} is the n t h {\displaystyle ^{th}} Fibonacci number -"

"What's Fibonacci number?" a pupil raised gingerly.

The educator acknowledged the query with a grin.

The educator sang mechanically, "In mathematics, the Fibonacci -"

"What's Fibonacci?" a student queried mechanically.

The professor acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The instructor declared quickly, "Fibonacci (; also US: , Italian: [fiboˈnattʃi]; c. 1170 – c. 1240–50), also known as Leonardo Bonacci, Leonardo of Pisa -"

"What's Pisa?" a girl demanded patiently.

The instructor paid no attention to the interruption and proceeded.

The schoolteacher announced mechanically, "-Pisa, or Leonardo Bigollo Pisano ('Leonardo the Traveller from Pisa'), was an Italian mathematician from the Republic of Pisa -"

"What's Republic of Pisa?" a pupil piped up politely.

The instructor paid no heed to the interruption and carried on.

The educator sang slowly, "-Republic of Pisa, considered to be 'the most talented Western mathematician of the Middle Ages'.The name he is commonly called, Fibonacci, was made up in 1838 by the Franco-Italian historian Guillaume Libri and is short for filius Bonacci ('son of Bonacci'). However, even earlier in 1506 a notary of the Holy Roman Empire, Perizolo mentions Leonardo as 'Lionardo Fibonacci'.Fibonacci popularized the Hindu–Arabic numeral system -"

The educator paused, anticipating a query from the pupils about Hindu–Arabic numeral system or some other topic.

The students sat straighter in their seats.

The schoolteacher continued.

The lecturer muttered sadly, "-Hindu–Arabic numeral system in the Western world primarily through his composition in 1202 of Liber Abaci -"

It was invented between the 1st and 4th centuries by Indian mathematicians. The system was adopted in Arabic mathematics by the 9th century. It became more widely known through the writings of the Persian mathematician Al-Khwārizmī (On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals, c. 825) and Al-Kindi (On the Use of the Hindu Numerals, c. 830). The system had spread to medieval Europe -"

The professor continued.

The schoolteacher sang sadly, "-Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) each year to determine its football champion. The game pits the champion of the Coastal Division against the champion of the Atlantic Division in a game that follows the conclusion of the regular season. The current champions are the Clemson Tigers of the Atlantic Division. The Atlantic Division has been represented by either Clemson or Florida -"

"What's Florida?" a girl wondered pointedly.

The professor ignored the interruption and continued.

The teacher said furiously, "-Florida State in twelve of fifteen years through 2019, including eleven straight from 2009 to 2019, and five straight by Clemson from 2015 to 2019. The Coastal Division was represented by either Georgia Tech or Virginia Tech for the first eight games from 2005 to 2012, but from 2013 to 2019 all seven Coastal teams each represented the division after Virginia won in 2019. Louisville, North Carolina State, and Syracuse have not won the Atlantic Division. Clemson in 2018 became the first team to win four consecutive ACC Championship Games, on the heels of FSU winning three straight. The Atlantic Division winners have gone on to win the ACC Championship Game for nine consecutive years as of 2019 and are 11–4 in the game overall. The Coastal teams won four consecutive years from 2007 to 2010 but have not won since. For the 2020 season, Notre Dame joined the ACC for conference play in football due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the ACC decided to use a division-less format for the game. Instead of representatives from two divisions, the two teams with the best conference records from a ten game conference schedule earned a spot in the game.The ACC Championship Game is held at Bank of America Stadium -"

The schoolteacher explained pointedly, "Brazil (Portuguese: Brasil; Brazilian Portuguese -"

The teacher looked around, expecting a query from the class about Brazilian Portuguese or some other topic.

The class sniggered.

The professor proceeded.

The teacher said robotically, "-Brazilian Portuguese: [bɾaˈziw]), officially the Federative Republic -"

"What's Republic?" a girl quizzed crudely.

The educator acknowledged the question with a grin.

The professor explained crudely, "A republic (from Latin res publica 'public affair') is a form of government in which 'power is held by the people and their elected representatives'. In republics, the country is considered a 'public matter', not the private concern or property of the rulers. The primary positions of power within a republic are attained through democracy or a mix of democracy with oligarchy or autocracy rather than being unalterably occupied by any given family lineage or group. With modern republicanism, it has become the opposing form of government to a monarchy and therefore a modern republic has no monarch as head of state.As of 2017, 159 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word 'republic' as part of their official names. Not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor is the word 'republic' used in the names of all states with elected governments. The word republic comes from the Latin term res publica, which literally means 'public thing', 'public matter', or 'public affair' and was used to refer to the state as a whole. The term developed its modern meaning in reference to the constitution of the ancient Roman Republic -"

"What's Roman Republic?" a pupil raised gingerly.

The lecturer ignored the interruption and proceeded.

The professor seethed quickly, "-Roman Republic, lasting from the overthrow of the kings in 509 BC to the establishment of the Empire -"

"What's Empire?" a student demanded quietly.

The schoolteacher paid no heed to the interruption and continued.

"Okay, going back to Brazil....", the schoolteacher said breathlessly.

The pupils watched quietly.

"Now, back again to Brazilian Portuguese....", the lecturer declared pointedly.

The pupils sat straighter in their seats.

"Alright, back again to Brazil....", the instructor announced mechanically.

The class sniggered.

"Okay, back again to Brazilian Portuguese....", the schoolteacher said.

The class suppressed giggles.

The teacher announced quickly, "-Brazilian Portuguese (português do Brasil, [poɾtʊˈɡez dʊ bɾaˈziw] or português brasileiro [poɾtʊˈɡez bɾaziˈlejɾʊ]) or also português sul americano is the set of dialects of the Portuguese language native to Brazil and the most influential form of Portuguese worldwide. It is spoken by almost all of the 200 million inhabitants of Brazil and spoken widely across the Brazilian diaspora -"

The lecturer stopped, listening for a question from the pupils about Brazilian diaspora or some other topic.

The pupils sat straighter in their seats.

The schoolteacher continued.

The lecturer announced timidly, "The Bromeliaceae (the bromeliads) is a family of monocot flowering plants of 75 genera and around 3590 known species native mainly to the tropical Americas -"

The schoolteacher paused, listening for a query from the pupils about Americas or some other topic.

The teacher continued.

The schoolteacher murmured excitedly, "-Americas, with a few species found in the American subtropics and one in tropical west Africa, Pitcairnia feliciana.It is among the basal families within the Poales and is the only family within the order that has septal nectaries and inferior ovaries. These inferior ovaries characterize the Bromelioideae -"

The instructor took a breath, expecting a question from the pupils about Bromelioideae or some other topic.

The instructor carried on.

The schoolteacher sang timidly, "-Bromelioideae, a subfamily of the Bromeliaceae. The family includes both epiphytes, such as Spanish moss -"

The teacher paused, anticipating a question from the class about Spanish moss or some other topic.

The pupils watched quietly.

The educator proceeded.

The educator declared slowly, "-Spanish moss (Tillandsia -"

"What's Tillandsia?" a boy piped up crudely.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The educator noted sadly, "Tillandsia is a genus of around 650 species of evergreen, perennial flowering plants in the family Bromeliaceae -"

The instructor stopped, listening for a query from the pupils about Bromeliaceae or some other topic.

The lecturer proceeded.

The professor murmured carefully, "-Bromeliaceae, native to the forests, mountains and deserts of northern Mexico and south-eastern United States, Mesoamerica and the Caribbean to mid Argentina. Their leaves, more or less silvery in color, are covered with specialized cells (trichomes) capable of rapidly absorbing water that gathers on them.Sometimes they are also commonly known as airplants because of their natural propensity to cling wherever conditions permit: telephone wires, tree branches, barks, bare rocks, etc. Their light seeds and a silky parachute facilitate this spread. Most Tillandsia species are epiphytes – which translates to 'upon a plant'. Some are aerophytes, which have a minimal root system and grow on shifting desert soil. Due to their epiphytic way of life, these plants will not grow in soil but live on the branches of trees, in deserts and on other substrates that will not be saturated with water for very long. They are perennial herbaceous plants which exhibit a multitude of physiological and morphological differences making this a diverse genus. Having native habitats that vary from being epiphytic and saxicolous, species have certain adaptations, such as root systems designed to anchor to other plants or substrates, and modified trichomes for water and nutrient intake. Some of the species, like the majority of bromeliaceae, grow as funnel bromeliads, with a compressed stem axis. The leaves are then close together in rosettes, and cover the lower areas of the leaves, forming a funnel for collecting water.These leaf rosettes, a common physical characteristic in Tillandsia species, collect nutrients and water. The flowers typically involve bright, vibrant colors, with blooms or inflorescences produced on a stalk or several stalks. The flower's color varies greatly; red, yellow, purple and pink flowers exist in this genus, and multicolored flowers are known. The bright colors attract pollinators. An air plant's foliage may also change color when it blooms, also attracting pollinators. The hermaphrodite flowers are threefold with double perianth. The three free sepals are symmetrical and pointed. The seeds have a 'parachute' similar to the dandelion.Common pollinators of this genera include moths, hummingbirds and, more recently recognized, bats. They have naturally been established in diverse environments such as equatorial tropical rain forests, high elevation Andes mountains, rock dwelling (saxicolous) regions, and Louisiana swamps, such as Spanish moss (T. usneoides), a species that grows atop tree limbs. But there are also species that live lithophytic, so on rocks (but also roofs and even telephone wires). The green species with their claim to a cool-humid climate live mostly more in the shade terrestrial or in the lower levels of the forests. In contrast, almost all gray species live in precipitation-poor areas with high humidity. They prefer the full sun and can therefore be found in the upper floors of the woods, on rocks or (rarely) on the ground. Many of the gray species are epiphytes. Some species are more or less xeromorphic. Tillandsias, like other bromeliads, can multiply through pollination and seed formation. Since Tillandsia are not self-fertile, the pollen must come from another plant of the same species. Tillandsia, depending on the species, may take months or years to flower. After flowering, the plant forms offsets and dies.Generally, the thinner-leafed varieties grow in rainy areas and the thick-leafed varieties in areas more subject to drought. Most species absorb moisture and nutrients through the leaves from rain, dew, dust, decaying leaves and insect matter, aided by structures called trichomes. Air plants are growing rapidly in popularity as a low maintenance household plant. Due to their minimal root system and other adaptations, they generally do not require frequent watering, no more than four times a week, allowing the plant to completely dry before watering again.The amount of light required depends on the species; overall, air plants with silver dusting and stiff foliage will require more sunlight than air plants with softer foliage. They generally need a strong light. In summer outside, however, they prefer the light shade of a tree at the hottest hours. Plant -"

"What's Plant?" a student asked quietly.

The teacher disregarded the interruption and carried on.

"Alright, turning back our attention to Bromeliaceae....", the schoolteacher announced calmly.

The pupils sat straighter in their seats.

"Now then, returning to Bromeliaceae....", the instructor murmured gingerly.

The class watched quietly.

"So, going back to Aechmea catendensis....", the instructor noted mechanically.

The pupils sat straighter in their seats.

The bell blared.

In 2001, the club received its current name Landstede Basketbal. The home games of the club are played in the Landstede Sportcentrum -"

"What's Landstede Sportcentrum?" a student wondered furiously.

The professor acknowledged the query with a nervous laugh.

The teacher noted politely, "The Landstede Sportcentrum is an indoor sports complex located in Zwolle, Netherlands -"

The instructor halted, listening for a query from the students about Netherlands or some other topic.

The students suppressed giggles.

The lecturer explained sadly, "-Netherlands, which is used as a sports arena and was opened in 2010. It is the home of basketball team Landstede Hammers. The 'centre court', which is used by both the club has a capacity of 1,200 people. The complex is owned by ROC Landstede, a company that is also main sponsor of the basketball and volleyball clubs. The Sportcentrum is also used for many other sports, like artistic gymnastics and table tennis. In 2011 and 2012, the international basketball tournament Basketball -"

"What's Basketball?" a girl asked mechanically.

The instructor acknowledged the question with a smirk.

The professor elaborated crudely, "Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated. Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate, both of which require considerable skill. On offense, players may use a variety of shots – the layup, the jump shot, or a dunk; on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots; either offense or defense may collect a rebound, that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard. It is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling. The five players on each side fall into five playing positions. The tallest player is usually the center, the second-tallest and strongest is the power forward, a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward, and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard, who implements the coach's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays (player positioning). Informally, players may play three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one. Invented in 1891 by Canadian-American gym teacher James Naismith in Springfield, Massachusetts -"

Acting as a huge heat reservoir, the ocean influences climate and weather patterns, the carbon cycle, and the water cycle. Oceanographers divide the ocean into different vertical and horizontal zones based on physical and biological conditions. The pelagic zone consists of the water column from surface to ocean floor throughout the open ocean. The water column is further categorized in other zones depending on depth and on how much light is present. The photic zone includes water from the surface to a depth of 1% of the surface light (about 200 m in the open ocean), where photosynthesis can occur. This makes the photic zone the most biodiverse.

Some of the country's 574 federally recognized tribes govern more than one reservation, while some share reservations, and others have no reservation at all. In addition, because of past land allotments, leading to sales to non–Native Americans, some reservations are severely fragmented, with each piece of tribal, individual, and privately held land being a separate enclave. This jumble of private and public real estate creates significant administrative, political and legal difficulties.The collective geographical area of all reservations is 56,200,000 acres (22,700,000 ha; 87,800 sq mi; 227,000 km2), approximately the size of the state of Idaho.

During campaigns and while in office, her husband took great care to accommodate her needs, as they were a devoted couple. Ida's ability to fulfill the role of First Lady was nevertheless limited. She was brought further grief by the deaths of her brother and later her husband, as McKinley was assassinated by an anarchist.

The teacher breathed mechanically, "-Panama. Despite its name, it is not a true finch, but now recognized as a member of the tanager family (Thraupidae), after being long placed in the Emberizidae -"

The teacher paused, anticipating a question from the class about Emberizidae or some other topic.

The lecturer continued.

The lecturer seethed sullenly, "-Emberizidae. It is the only member of the genus Acanthidops. The scientific name commemorates the American ornithologist Spencer Fullerton Baird -"

"What's Spencer Fullerton Baird?" a boy piped up crudely.

The instructor paid no attention to the interruption and carried on.

The professor muttered mechanically, "-Spencer Fullerton Baird. The peg-billed finch was formally described in 1882 by the American ornithologist Robert Ridgway -"

"What's Robert Ridgway?" a student raised confidently.

The educator acknowledged the query with a smile.

The lecturer muttered gently, "Robert Ridgway (July 2, 1850 – March 25, 1929) was an American ornithologist specializing in systematics. He was appointed in 1880 by Spencer Fullerton Baird -"

The lecturer halted, waiting for a query from the pupils about Spencer Fullerton Baird or some other topic.

The class stifled their yawns.

The schoolteacher proceeded.

The professor declared politely, "-Spencer Fullerton Baird, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution -"

"What's Smithsonian Institution?" a girl asked calmly.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a smirk.

The lecturer sang pointedly, "The Smithsonian -"

The instructor took a breath, anticipating a query from the class about Smithsonian or some other topic.

The pupils suppressed giggles.

The teacher carried on.

The lecturer elaborated patiently, "-Smithsonian Institution ( smith-SOH-nee-ən), or simply, the Smithsonian, is a group of museums and education and research centers, the largest such complex in the world, created by the U.S. government 'for the increase and diffusion of knowledge'. Founded on August 10, 1846, it operates as a trust instrumentality and is not formally a part of any of the three branches of the federal government. The institution is named after its founding donor, British scientist James Smithson -"

"What's James Smithson?" a student said quietly.

The instructor acknowledged the query with a grin.

The professor paid no attention to the interruption and carried on.

The educator sang gently, "-James Smithson. It was originally organized as the United States National Museum, but that name ceased to exist administratively in 1967.Called 'the nation's attic' for its eclectic holdings of 154 million items, the Institution's 19 museums, 21 libraries, nine research centers, and zoo include historical and architectural landmarks, mostly located in the District of Columbia. Additional facilities are located in Maryland -"

"What's Maryland?" a student quizzed patiently.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a nervous laugh.

The schoolteacher elaborated timidly, "Maryland (US: (listen) MERR-ə-lənd) is a state in the Mid-Atlantic and Southern regions of the United States -"

"What's United States?" a girl interjected sullenly.

The educator ignored the interruption and carried on.

The teacher said quickly, "-United States, bordering Virginia -"

"What's Virginia?" a boy said mechanically.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The instructor announced crudely, "Virginia ( (listen)), officially the Commonwealth of Virginia, is a state in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern regions of the United States -"

"What's United States?" a boy wondered gently.

The instructor acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The educator muttered, "The United States (U.S. or US -"

"What's US?" a girl questioned gently.

The instructor acknowledged the question with a grin.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a smirk.

The lecturer elaborated breathlessly, "An Indian reservation is an area of land tenure governed by a federally recognized Native American tribal nation under the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs -"

"What's Bureau of Indian Affairs?" a student raised timidly.

The professor paid no attention to the interruption and proceeded.

The teacher muttered quickly, "-Bureau of Indian Affairs, rather than by the government of the state in which it is located. The 326 Indian reservations in the United States -"

The professor looked around, waiting for a question from the students about United States or some other topic.

The pupils stifled their yawns.

The lecturer continued.

"So, back again to United States....", the schoolteacher explained slowly.

The class sat straighter in their seats.

# Lesson 39: Oruro Department

"Hello, class! Today we'll be discussing Oruro Department," the lecturer breathed gently.

The students sat straighter in their seats.

The educator announced pointedly, "Oruro (Spanish pronunciation: [oˈɾuɾo]; Quechua: Uru Uru; Aymara: Ururu) is a department in Bolivia -"

The educator halted, waiting for a question from the pupils about Bolivia or some other topic.

The pupils listened in rapt attention.

The schoolteacher proceeded.

The lecturer elaborated carefully, "-Bolivia, with an area of 53,588 km2 (20,690 sq mi). Its capital is the city of Oruro. According to the 2012 census, the Oruro department had a population of 494,178. The department is divided into 16 provinces which are further subdivided into municipalities and cantons. Note: Eduardo Abaroa Province (#5) is both north of and south of Sebastián Pagador Province -"

"What's Sebastián Pagador Province?" a pupil blurted gingerly.

The professor disregarded the interruption and proceeded.

The educator acknowledged the question with a nod.

The professor noted breathlessly, "The Republic of Venezuela -"

The lecturer looked around, listening for a query from the class about Venezuela or some other topic.

The class stifled their yawns.

The educator carried on.

The teacher seethed pointedly, "-Venezuela was a democratic republic first established in 1958, and replaced in 1999 by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. Venezuela saw ten years of military dictatorship from 1948 to 1958. After the 1948 Venezuelan coup d'état brought an end to a three-year experiment in democracy (Spanish: El Trienio Adeco -"

The instructor halted, expecting a query from the class about El Trienio Adeco or some other topic.

The pupils watched quietly.

The schoolteacher proceeded.

The teacher noted aggressively, "-El Trienio Adeco), a triumvirate of military personnel controlled the government until 1952, when it held presidential elections. These were free enough to produce results unacceptable to the government, leading them to be falsified and to one of the three leaders, Marcos Pérez Jiménez -"

"What's Marcos Pérez Jiménez?" a pupil asked happily.

The teacher ignored the interruption and continued.

The lecturer said robotically, "-Marcos Pérez Jiménez, assuming the Presidency. His government was brought to an end by the 1958 Venezuelan coup d'état -"

"What's 1958 Venezuelan coup d'état?" a student piped up carefully.

The professor acknowledged the question with a nod.

The schoolteacher declared crudely, "The 1958 Venezuelan coup d'état took place on 23 January 1958, when the dictator Marcos Pérez Jiménez -"

"What's Marcos Pérez Jiménez?" a student queried aggressively.

The educator acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The instructor breathed patiently, "Marcos Evangelista Pérez Jiménez (25 April 1914 – 20 September 2001) was a Venezuela -"

"What's Venezuela?" a girl interjected.

The lecturer looked around, listening for a question from the students about Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela or some other topic.

The pupils sat straighter in their seats.

The teacher proceeded.

The instructor sang gently, "-Bolivarian Republic -"

"What's Republic?" a student wondered calmly.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The educator seethed happily, "A republic (from Latin res publica 'public affair') is a form of government in which 'power is held by the people and their elected representatives'. In republics, the country is considered a 'public matter', not the private concern or property of the rulers. The primary positions of power within a republic are attained through democracy or a mix of democracy with oligarchy or autocracy rather than being unalterably occupied by any given family lineage or group. With modern republicanism, it has become the opposing form of government to a monarchy and therefore a modern republic has no monarch as head of state.As of 2017, 159 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word 'republic' as part of their official names. Not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor is the word 'republic' used in the names of all states with elected governments. The word republic comes from the Latin term res publica, which literally means 'public thing', 'public matter', or 'public affair' and was used to refer to the state as a whole. The term developed its modern meaning in reference to the constitution of the ancient Roman Republic, lasting from the overthrow of the kings in 509 BC to the establishment of the Empire -"

"What's Empire?" a boy questioned happily.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a nervous laugh.

The educator said patiently, "An Empire is a sovereign state made up of several territories and peoples subject to a single ruling authority, often an emperor. A state can become an empire either by a narrow definition through having an emperor and being named as such, or by a broad definition as stated above as an aggregate territory under the rule of supreme authorities such as the Roman Empire -"

"What's Roman Empire?" a pupil queried gingerly.

The teacher paid no attention to the interruption and continued.

The schoolteacher declared furiously, "-Roman Empire. An empire can be made solely of contiguous territories, such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire or the Russian Empire, or include territories which are far remote from the 'home' country of the empire, such as a colonial empire. Aside from the more formal usage, the word empire can also refer colloquially to a large-scale business enterprise (e.g. a transnational corporation), a political organisation controlled by a single individual (a political boss), or a group (political bosses). The concept of empire is associated with other such concepts as imperialism, colonialism, and globalization, with imperialism referring to the creation and maintenance of unequal relationships between nations and not necessarily the policy of a state headed by an emperor or empress. Empire is often used as a term to describe displeasure to overpowering situations.There are two main ways to establish and maintain an imperial political structure: (i) as a territorial empire of direct conquest and control with force or (ii) as a coercive, hegemonic empire of indirect conquest and control with power. The former method provides greater tribute and direct political control, yet limits further expansion because it absorbs military forces to fixed garrisons. The latter method provides less tribute and indirect control, but avails military forces for further expansion. Territorial empires (e.g. the Macedonian Empire and Byzantine Empire -"

"What's Byzantine Empire?" a student blurted robotically.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a nod.

The professor said politely, "The Byzantine -"

"What's Byzantine?" a boy said excitedly.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The professor murmured breathlessly, "The Byzantine -"

The schoolteacher took a breath, waiting for a question from the class about Byzantine or some other topic.

The educator continued.

The professor noted quickly, "-Byzantine Empire, also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire -"

"What's Roman Empire?" a pupil queried.

The educator paid no heed to the interruption and proceeded.

The lecturer sang quietly, "-Roman Empire or Byzantium -"

"What's Byzantium?" a girl quizzed excitedly.

The instructor acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The teacher said sullenly, "The Byzantine -"

The schoolteacher stopped, anticipating a question from the class about Byzantine or some other topic.

The students sat straighter in their seats.

The instructor continued.

The teacher announced robotically, "-Byzantine Empire -"

"What's Empire?" a boy asked breathlessly.

The professor acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

# Lesson 41: Physolaesthus

"Good morning, class! Today we'll be discussing Physolaesthus," the professor explained aggressively.

The pupils sat straighter in their seats.

The teacher murmured calmly, "Physolaesthus is a genus of beetles in the family Carabidae -"

"What's Carabidae?" a pupil raised gingerly.

The educator acknowledged the query with a nod.

The teacher explained furiously, "In chemistry, a carbide usually describes a compound composed of carbon and a metal. In metallurgy, carbiding or carburizing is the process for producing carbide coatings on a metal piece. The carbides of the group 4, 5 and 6 transition metals (with the exception of chromium) are often described as interstitial compounds. These carbides have metallic properties and are refractory. Some exhibit a range of stoichiometries, being a non-stoichiometric mixture of various carbides arising due to crystal defects. Some of them, including titanium carbide and tungsten carbide, are important industrially and are used to coat metals in cutting tools.The long-held view is that the carbon atoms fit into octahedral interstices in a close-packed metal lattice when the metal atom radius is greater than approximately 135 pm: When the metal atoms are cubic close-packed, (ccp), then filling all of the octahedral interstices with carbon achieves 1:1 stoichiometry with the rock salt structure. When the metal atoms are hexagonal close-packed, (hcp), as the octahedral interstices lie directly opposite each other on either side of the layer of metal atoms, filling only one of these with carbon achieves 2:1 stoichiometry with the CdI2 structure.The following table shows actual structures of the metals and their carbides. (N.B. the body centered cubic structure adopted by vanadium, niobium, tantalum, chromium, molybdenum and tungsten is not a close-packed lattice.) The notation 'h/2' refers to the M2C type structure described above, which is only an approximate description of the actual structures. The simple view that the lattice of the pure metal 'absorbs' carbon atoms can be seen to be untrue as the packing of the metal atom lattice in the carbides is different from the packing in the pure metal, although it is technically correct that the carbon atoms fit into the octahedral interstices of a close-packed metal lattice. For a long time the non-stoichiometric phases were believed to be disordered with a random filling of the interstices, however short and longer range ordering has been detected.Iron forms a number of carbides, Fe3C, Fe7C3 and Fe2C. The best known is cementite, Fe3C, which is present in steels. These carbides are more reactive than the interstitial carbides; for example, the carbides of Cr, Mn, Fe, Co and Ni are all hydrolysed by dilute acids and sometimes by water, to give a mixture of hydrogen and hydrocarbons. These compounds share features with both the inert interstitials and the more reactive salt-like carbides.Some metals, such as lead and tin, are believed not to form carbides under any circumstances. There exists however a mixed titanium-tin carbide, which is a two-dimensional conductor. Carbides can be generally classified by the chemical bonds type as follows: (i) salt-like (ionic), (ii) covalent compounds, (iii) interstitial compounds, and (iv) 'intermediate' transition metal carbides. Examples include calcium carbide (CaC2), silicon carbide (SiC), tungsten carbide (WC; often called, simply, carbide when referring to machine tooling), and cementite (Fe3C), each used in key industrial applications. The naming of ionic carbides is not systematic. Salt-like carbides are composed of highly electropositive elements such as the alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, and group 3 metals, including scandium, yttrium, and lanthanum. Aluminium from group 13 forms carbides, but gallium, indium, and thallium do not. These materials feature isolated carbon centers, often described as 'C4−', in the methanides or methides; two-atom units, 'C2−2', in the acetylides; and three-atom units, 'C4−3', in the allylides. The graphite intercalation compound KC8, prepared from vapour of potassium and graphite, and the alkali metal derivatives of C60 are not usually classified as carbides. = = Methanides are a subset of carbides distinguished by their tendency to decompose in water producing methane. Three examples are aluminium carbide Al4C3, magnesium carbide Mg2C and beryllium carbide Be2C. Transition metal -"

The instructor looked around, anticipating a question from the students about Transition metal or some other topic.

The class sniggered.

The educator continued.

"Now, returning to Physolaesthus....", the educator noted excitedly.

The pupils sat straighter in their seats.

The schoolteacher explained politely, "-Carabidae, containing the following species: Physolaesthus australis -"

The schoolteacher paused, listening for a question from the students about Physolaesthus australis or some other topic.

The educator continued.

The educator seethed timidly, "-Physolaesthus australis Chaudoir, 1850 Physolaesthus caviceps -"

The lecturer took a breath, waiting for a question from the pupils about Physolaesthus caviceps or some other topic.

The pupils suppressed giggles.

The schoolteacher carried on.

"What's Arthur Waley?" a girl blurted timidly.

The professor acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The instructor murmured happily, "Arthur David Waley (born Arthur David Schloss, 19 August 1889 – 27 June 1966) was an English orientalist and sinologist who achieved both popular and scholarly acclaim for his translations of Chinese and Japanese poetry -"

"What's Japanese poetry?" a pupil questioned quietly.

The teacher disregarded the interruption and proceeded.

The lecturer sang quietly, "-Japanese poetry. Among his honours were the CBE in 1952, the Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry in 1953, and he was invested as a Companion of Honour -"

"What's Companion of Honour?" a girl blurted aggressively.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a grin.

The lecturer noted robotically, "The Order of the Companions of Honour is an order of the Commonwealth realms -"

"What's Commonwealth realms?" a pupil said gently.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the query with a smile.

The educator elaborated timidly, "A Commonwealth realm is a sovereign state which has Elizabeth II -"

The educator looked around, listening for a query from the pupils about Elizabeth II or some other topic.

The professor continued.

The schoolteacher seethed crudely, "-Elizabeth II as its monarch and head of state. Each realm functions as an independent state, equal with the other realms. In 1952, Elizabeth II was the monarch and head of state of seven independent states—the United Kingdom -"

An example of this range of meanings is that the love of a mother differs from the love of a spouse, which differs from the love of food. Most commonly, love refers to a feeling of a strong attraction and emotional attachment.Love is considered to be both positive and negative, with its virtue representing human kindness, compassion, and affection, as 'the unselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another' and its vice representing human moral flaw, akin to vanity, selfishness, amour-propre, and egotism, as potentially leading people into a type of mania, obsessiveness or codependency. It may also describe compassionate and affectionate actions towards other humans, one's self, or animals. In its various forms, love acts as a major facilitator of interpersonal relationships and, owing to its central psychological importance, is one of the most common themes in the creative arts. Love has been postulated to be a function that keeps human beings together against menaces and to facilitate the continuation of the species.Ancient Greek philosophers identified six forms of love: essentially, familial love (in Greek, Storge -"

Some life forms, including terrestrial plants and terrestrial animals, have developed from predecessor species that originated in bodies of water. Areas where land meets large bodies of water are called coastal zones. The division between land and water is a fundamental concept to humans. The demarcation line between land and water can vary by local jurisdiction and other factors. A maritime boundary is one example of a political demarcation.

World War II was by far the deadliest conflict in human history; it resulted in 70 to 85 million fatalities, a majority being civilians. Tens of millions of people died due to genocides (including the Holocaust), starvation, massacres, and disease.

The Italic peoples are descended from the Indo-European speaking peoples who inhabited Italy from at least the second millennium BC onwards. Latins achieved a dominant position among these tribes, establishing ancient Roman civilization. During this development, other Italic tribes adopted Latin language and culture in a process known as Romanization. This process was eventually extended to certain parts of Europe. The ethnic groups which emerged as a result are known as Romance peoples -"

"What's Romance peoples?" a student questioned carefully.

The instructor acknowledged the question with a nod.

The schoolteacher breathed pointedly, "The Romance languages (less commonly Latin -"

The educator halted, waiting for a question from the students about Latin or some other topic.

The class listened in rapt attention.

The professor carried on.

The professor seethed excitedly, "-Latin languages, or Neo-Latin languages) are the modern languages that evolved from Vulgar Latin -"

"What's Vulgar Latin?" a student raised mechanically.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a nod.

The instructor seethed slowly, "Vulgar Latin -"

The instructor halted, expecting a query from the students about Latin or some other topic.

The students suppressed giggles.

The educator carried on.

The instructor elaborated timidly, "-Latin, also known as Popular or Colloquial Latin, is non-literary Latin spoken from the Late Roman Republic onwards. Depending on the time period, its literary counterpart was either Classical Latin -"

The educator paused, waiting for a question from the students about Classical Latin or some other topic.

The instructor carried on.

The instructor breathed breathlessly, "-Classical Latin or Late Latin. During the Classical period, Roman authors referred to the informal, everyday variety of their own language as sermo plebeius or sermo vulgaris, meaning 'common speech'.The modern usage of the term Vulgar Latin dates to the Renaissance -"

The educator stopped, expecting a query from the students about Renaissance or some other topic.

The class watched quietly.

The instructor carried on.

The educator murmured slowly, "-Renaissance, when Italian thinkers began to theorize that their own language originated in a sort of 'corrupted' Latin that they assumed formed an entity distinct from the literary Classical variety, though opinions differed greatly on the nature of this 'vulgar' dialect.The early 19th-century French linguist Raynouard is often regarded as the father of modern Romance philology -"

The educator took a breath, listening for a query from the students about Romance philology or some other topic.

The students suppressed giggles.

The teacher continued.

The instructor explained patiently, "-Romance philology. Observing that the Romance languages have many features in common that are not found in Latin, at least not in 'proper' or Classical Latin, he concluded that the former must have all had some common ancestor (which he believed most closely resembled Old Occitan) that replaced Latin some time before the year 1000. This he dubbed la langue romane or 'the Roman language'.The first truly modern treatise on Romance linguistics, however, and the first to apply the comparative method, was Friedrich Christian Diez -"

"What's Friedrich Christian Diez?" a girl piped up politely.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the query with a nod.

The educator explained quietly, "Friedrich Christian Diez (15 March 1794 – 29 May 1876) was a German philologist. The two works on which his fame rests are the Grammar of the Romance Languages (published 1836–1844), and the Etymological Dictionary of the Romance Languages (1853, and later editions). He spent most of his career at University of Bonn -"

"What's University of Bonn?" a girl quizzed gingerly.

The professor paid no heed to the interruption and continued.

The lecturer said crudely, "-University of Bonn. Diez was born at Giessen -"

"What's Giessen?" a boy asked.

The professor acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The educator breathed sullenly, "Giessen, spelled Gießen in German (German pronunciation: [ˈɡiːsn̩] (listen)), is a town in the German federated state (Bundesland) of Hesse, capital of both the district of Giessen and the administrative region of Giessen. The population is approximately 90,000, with roughly 37,000 university students.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The schoolteacher noted sullenly, "Germany (German: Deutschland, pronounced [ˈdɔʏtʃlant] (listen)), officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a country in Central Euro -"

"What's Euro?" a girl piped up happily.

"What's North Pole?" a girl wondered gently.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a nod.

The professor declared pointedly, "The South Pole, also known as the Geographic South Pole or Terrestrial South Pole, is one of the two points where Earth's axis of rotation intersects its surface. It is the southernmost point on the surface of Earth and lies on the opposite side of Earth from the North Pole -"

"What's North Pole?" a student said breathlessly.

The lecturer carried on.

The schoolteacher seethed politely, "-North Pole. Situated on the continent of Antarctica -"

The lecturer stopped, waiting for a question from the class about Antarctica or some other topic.

The schoolteacher continued.

The lecturer breathed calmly, "-Antarctica, it is the site of the United States Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station, which was established in 1956 and has been permanently staffed since that year. The Geographic South Pole is distinct from the South Magnetic Pole, the position of which is defined based on Earth's magnetic field. The South Pole is at the centre of the Southern Hemisphere. For most purposes, the Geographic South Pole is defined as the southern point of the two points where Earth's axis of rotation intersects its surface (the other being the Geographic North Pole). However, Earth's axis of rotation is actually subject to very small 'wobbles' (polar motion), so this definition is not adequate for very precise work. The geographic coordinates of the South Pole are usually given simply as 90°S, since its longitude is geometrically undefined and irrelevant. When a longitude is desired, it may be given as 0°. At the South Pole, all directions face north. For this reason, directions at the Pole are given relative to 'grid north', which points northward along the prime meridian. Along tight latitude circles, clockwise is east, and anti-clockwise is west, opposite to the North Pole. The Geographic South Pole is presently located on the continent of Antarctica, although this has not been the case for all of Earth's history because of continental drift. It sits atop a featureless, barren, windswept and icy plateau at an altitude of 2,835 m (9,301 ft) above sea level, and is located about 1,300 km (810 mi) from the nearest open sea at the Bay of Whales -"

"What's Bay of Whales?" a student wondered carefully.

The educator acknowledged the question with a nervous laugh.

The educator seethed robotically, "The Bay of Whale -"

"What's Whale?" a boy questioned quietly.

The lecturer paid no heed to the interruption and continued.

The professor sang confidently, "-Whales was a natural ice harbour, or iceport, indenting the front of the Ross Ice Shelf -"

The schoolteacher stopped, waiting for a query from the students about Ross Ice Shelf or some other topic.

The schoolteacher proceeded.

The teacher seethed confidently, "-Ross Ice Shelf just north of Roosevelt Island, Antarctica -"

"What's Antarctica?" a student queried robotically.

The educator paid no heed to the interruption and carried on.

The schoolteacher breathed gently, "-Antarctica. It is the southernmost point of open ocean not only of the Ross Sea -"

"What's Ross Sea?" a pupil questioned breathlessly.

The teacher paid no heed to the interruption and carried on.

"Now, turning back our attention to South Pole....", the instructor muttered happily.

The class sat straighter in their seats.
