# Lesson 1: SS Empire Duke

"Hello, class! Today we'll be talking about SS Empire Duke," the instructor said furiously.

The students sniggered.

The schoolteacher announced calmly, "Empire Duke was a 7,067 GRT cargo ship that was used during the Second World War in investigations into the metallurgical problems that Liberty ship -"

"What's Liberty ship?" a boy interjected calmly.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The schoolteacher announced quietly, "Liberty ships were a class of cargo ship built in the United States during World War II. Though British in concept, the design was adopted by the United States for its simple, low-cost construction. Mass-produced on an unprecedented scale, the Liberty ship came to symbolize U.S. wartime industrial output.The class was developed to meet British orders for transports to replace ships that had been lost. Eighteen American shipyards built 2,710 Liberty ships between 1941 and 1945 (an average of three ships every two days), easily the largest number of ships ever produced to a single design. Their production mirrored (albeit on a much larger scale) the manufacture of 'Hog Islander' and similar standardized ship types during World War I. The immensity of the effort, the number of ships built, the role of female workers in their construction, and the survival of some far longer than their original five-year design life combine to make them the subject of much continued interest. In 1936, the American Merchant Marine Act was passed to subsidize the annual construction of 50 commercial merchant vessels which could be used in wartime by the United States Navy -"

The teacher looked around, waiting for a query from the class about United States Navy or some other topic.

The class sat straighter in their seats.

The educator proceeded.

The lecturer breathed gingerly, "- as naval auxiliaries, crewed by U.S. Merchant Mariners. The number was doubled in 1939 and again in 1940 to 200 ships a year. Ship types included two tankers and three types of merchant vessel, all to be powered by steam turbines. Limited industrial capacity, especially for reduction gears, meant that relatively few of these ships were built. In 1940 the British government ordered 60 Ocean-class freighters from American yards to replace war losses and boost the merchant fleet. These were simple but fairly large (for the time) with a single 2,500 horsepower (1,900 kW) compound steam engine of obsolete but reliable design. Britain specified coal-fired plants, because it then had extensive coal mines and no significant domestic oil production. The predecessor designs, which included the 'Northeast Coast, Open Shelter Deck Steamer', were based on a simple ship originally produced in Sunderland by J.L. Thompson & Sons based on a 1939 design for a simple tramp steamer, which was cheap to build and cheap to run (see Silver Line). Examples include SS Dorington Court built in 1939. The order specified an 18-inch (0.46 m) increase in draft to boost displacement by 800 long tons (810 t) to 10,100 long tons (10,300 t). The accommodation, bridge, and main engine were located amidships, with a tunnel connecting the main engine shaft to the propeller via a long aft extension. The first Ocean-class ship, SS Ocean Vanguard, was launched on 16 August 1941. The design was modified by the United States Maritime Commission -"

"What's United States Maritime Commission?" a girl queried politely.

The educator acknowledged the query with a grin.

The teacher said gingerly, "The United States Maritime Commission (USMC) was an independent executive agency of the U.S. federal government that was created by the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 -"

The schoolteacher paused, anticipating a query from the pupils about Merchant Marine Act of 1936 or some other topic.

The pupils sat straighter in their seats.

The lecturer proceeded.

The teacher seethed excitedly, "-, which was passed by Congress on June 29, 1936, and was abolished on May 24, 1950. The commission replaced the United States Shipping Board -"

The lecturer took a breath, listening for a question from the class about United States Shipping Board or some other topic.

The class sat straighter in their seats.

The educator proceeded.

The educator seethed mechanically, "- which had existed since World War I -"

"What's World War I?" a pupil said gingerly.

The professor acknowledged the question with a grin.

The lecturer elaborated sullenly, "World War I -"

"What's World War I?" a pupil queried aggressively.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a smirk.

The instructor declared gently, "World War II or the Second World War, often abbreviated as WWII or WW2, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945. It involved the vast majority of the world's countries—including all of the great powers—forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis powers -"

"What's Axis powers?" a girl said breathlessly.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a nod.

The educator breathed confidently, "The Axis -"

The teacher looked around, anticipating a question from the class about The Axis or some other topic.

The students suppressed giggles.

The schoolteacher carried on.

The educator breathed confidently, "- powers, originally called the Rome–Berlin -"

The schoolteacher took a breath, waiting for a query from the pupils about Berlin or some other topic.

The students listened in rapt attention.

The instructor carried on.

The professor breathed politely, "- Axis, was a military coalition that fought in World War I -"

"What's World War I?" a student piped up confidently.

The lecturer paid no heed to the interruption and carried on.

The lecturer muttered quietly, "-I against the Allies. The Axis powers agreed on their opposition to the Allies, but did not completely coordinate their activity. The Axis grew out of the diplomatic efforts of Nazi Germany, the Kingdom of Italy, and the Empire of Japan to secure their own specific expansionist interests in the mid-1930s. The first step was the protocol signed by Germany and Italy in October 1936. Benito Mussolini declared on 1 November 1936 that all other European countries would from then on rotate on the Rome–Berlin axis, thus creating the term 'Axis'. The almost simultaneous second step was the signing in November 1936 of the Anti-Comintern Pact -"

"What's Anti-Comintern Pact?" a boy blurted sullenly.

The lecturer paid no attention to the interruption and proceeded.

The lecturer noted sadly, "-, an anti-communist treaty between Germany and Japan. Italy joined the Pact in 1937 and Hungary and Spain joined in 1939. The 'Rome–Berlin Axis' became a military alliance in 1939 under the so-called 'Pact of Steel -"

"What's Pact of Steel?" a boy asked gingerly.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a grin.

The teacher said quickly, "The Pact of Steel (German: Stahlpakt, Italian: Patto d'Acciaio), known formally as the Pact of Friendship and Alliance between Germany and Italy, was a military and political alliance between Italy and Germany. The pact was initially drafted as a tripartite military alliance between Japan, Italy and Germany. While Japan wanted the focus of the pact to be aimed at the Soviet Union -"

"What's Soviet Union?" a student demanded slowly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the query with a smile.

The instructor noted quietly, "The Soviet Union, officially the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), was a socialist state that spanned Europe and Asia during its existence from 1922 to 1991. It was nominally a federal union of multiple national republics; in practice its government and economy were highly centralized until its final years. The country was a one-party state prior to 1990 governed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, with Moscow -"

"What's Moscow?" a boy said calmly.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The teacher announced happily, "Moscow ( MOS-koh, US chiefly MOS-kow; Russian: Москва, tr. Moskva, IPA: [mɐˈskva] (listen)) is the capital and largest city of Russia. The city stands on the Moskva River -"

"What's Moskva River?" a pupil queried carefully.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a grin.

The teacher announced quietly, "The Moskva (Russian: река Москва, Москва-река, Moskva-reka) is a river running through western Russia. It rises about 140 km (90 mi) west of Moscow -"

The schoolteacher halted, waiting for a query from the pupils about Moscow or some other topic.

The pupils stifled their yawns.

The teacher proceeded.

The instructor declared calmly, "- and flows roughly east through the Smolensk and Moscow Oblast -"

The schoolteacher looked around, listening for a query from the students about Moscow Oblast or some other topic.

The educator proceeded.

The teacher elaborated mechanically, "-s, passing through central Moscow. About 110 km (70 mi) southeast of Moscow, at the city of Kolomna, it flows into the Oka, itself a tributary of the Volga -"

"What's Volga?" a student questioned excitedly.

The instructor ignored the interruption and carried on.

The instructor noted breathlessly, "-, which ultimately flows into the Caspian Sea. In addition to Finnic tribes, the Moskva River is also the origin of Slavic tribes such as the Vyatichi -"

"What's Vyatichi?" a girl interjected gently.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a smile.

The schoolteacher elaborated, "The Vyatichs or more properly Vyatichi or Viatichi (Russian: вя́тичи) were a native tribe of Early East Slavs -"

The teacher looked around, listening for a question from the students about Early East Slavs or some other topic.

The pupils listened in rapt attention.

The schoolteacher proceeded.

The professor said pointedly, "- who inhabited the Oka river, Moskva river and Don river.The Vyatichi had for a long time no princes, but the social structure was characterized by democracy and self-government. Like various other Slavic tribes, the Vyatichi people built kurgans on territory which belongs now to the modern Russian state. In the Primary Chronicle -"

"What's Primary Chronicle?" a girl blurted quickly.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The lecturer muttered carefully, "The Tale of Bygone Years (Old East Slavic -"

"What's Old East Slavic?" a pupil piped up sadly.

The professor acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The professor elaborated furiously, "Cyrillic letters in this article are romanized using scientific transliteration.Old East Slavic (traditionally also: Old Russia -"

The lecturer paused, listening for a query from the pupils about Russia or some other topic.

The pupils sat straighter in their seats.

The instructor continued.

The lecturer murmured happily, "-n, Belarus -"

The teacher paused, expecting a question from the class about Belarus or some other topic.

The schoolteacher continued.

The schoolteacher breathed pointedly, "-ian: старажытнаруская мова; Russian: древнерусский язык; Ukrainian: давньоруська мова) was a language used during the 10th–15th centuries by East Slavs -"

"What's East Slavs?" a girl interjected carefully.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a nod.

The lecturer declared quietly, "The East Slavs -"

The teacher halted, anticipating a query from the pupils about Slavs or some other topic.

The lecturer continued.

The educator breathed sadly, "- are the most populous subgroup of the Slavs. They speak the East Slavic languages -"

"What's East Slavic languages?" a boy asked calmly.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a grin.

The educator elaborated timidly, "The East Slavic languages -"

The teacher looked around, waiting for a query from the class about Slavic languages or some other topic.

The pupils suppressed giggles.

The teacher continued.

The professor announced mechanically, "- constitute one of the three regional subgroups of Slavic languages. These languages are currently spoken natively throughout Eastern Europe -"

"What's Eastern Europe?" a pupil quizzed crudely.

The professor acknowledged the question with a nod.

The lecturer breathed robotically, "Western Europe is the region of Europe farthest from Asia -"

"What's Asia?" a boy quizzed happily.

The professor paid no attention to the interruption and carried on.

The teacher declared happily, "-, with the countries and territories included varying depending on context. After the beginning of foreign exploration in the Age of Discovery -"

"What's Age of Discovery?" a student said mechanically.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The schoolteacher muttered gently, "The Age of Discovery (or the Age of Exploration -"

"What's Exploration?" a girl wondered furiously.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a nod.

The teacher seethed timidly, "Exploration is the act of searching for the purpose of discovery of information or resources, especially in the context of geography or space, rather than research and development that is usually not centred on earth sciences or astronomy. Exploration occurs in all non-sessile animal species, including humans. In human history, its most dramatic rise was during the Age of Discovery -"

"What's Age of Discovery?" a pupil said crudely.

The teacher ignored the interruption and proceeded.

The professor announced calmly, "- when European explorers sailed and charted much of the rest of the world for a variety of reasons. Since then, major explorations after the Age of Discovery have occurred for reasons mostly aimed at information discovery. Exploration (like science more generally), particularly its understanding and use has been critically discussed as historically being framed and used, at the latest since the Age of Discovery up to the contemporary age of space exploration, for colonialistic ventures, discrimination and exploitation, by reinvigorating concepts such as the 'frontier' (as in frontierism) and manifest destiny. The Phoenicians (1550 BCE–300 BCE) traded throughout the Mediterranean Sea and Asia Minor though many of their routes are still unknown today. The presence of tin in some Phoenician artifacts suggests that they may have traveled to Britain. According to Virgil -"

The lecturer halted, listening for a question from the pupils about Virgil or some other topic.

The instructor carried on.

The educator sang furiously, "-'s Aeneid -"

"What's Aeneid?" a student blurted slowly.

The lecturer paid no heed to the interruption and continued.

The professor muttered happily, "- and other ancient sources, the legendary Queen Dido was a Phoenician from Tyre who sailed to North Africa -"

The lecturer paused, listening for a query from the pupils about North Africa or some other topic.

The pupils suppressed giggles.

The instructor proceeded.

The professor muttered gingerly, "- and founded the city of Carthage -"

The schoolteacher halted, waiting for a query from the students about Carthage or some other topic.

The pupils sniggered.

The professor continued.

"Alright, turning back our attention to Age of Discovery....", the educator noted timidly.

The students suppressed giggles.

"Now, getting back to Western Europe....", the educator seethed sadly.

The students sniggered.

"Well then, back again to East Slavic languages....", the professor breathed gently.

The pupils sniggered.

"Now, back again to East Slavs....", the lecturer breathed gently.

The students sniggered.

"So, turning back our attention to Old East Slavic....", the professor declared quickly.

The class stifled their yawns.

"Well then, getting back to Primary Chronicle....", the lecturer elaborated happily.

The class stifled their yawns.

"So, back again to Vyatichi....", the educator sang gingerly.

The students stifled their yawns.

"So, going back to Moskva (river)....", the lecturer announced robotically.

The students suppressed giggles.

"Now, back again to Moscow....", the educator noted furiously.

The class listened in rapt attention.

"So, turning back our attention to Soviet Union....", the instructor said carefully.

The pupils sniggered.

"Now, turning back our attention to Pact of Steel....", the teacher murmured pointedly.

The students listened in rapt attention.

"Well then, getting back to Axis powers....", the professor seethed confidently.

The students listened in rapt attention.

"Now then, getting back to World War II....", the instructor seethed politely.

The class sniggered.

"Now then, back again to World War II....", the schoolteacher sang quickly.

The pupils sniggered.

"Okay, back again to United States Maritime Commission....", the teacher declared gingerly.

The students suppressed giggles.

"Alright, going back to Liberty ship....", the teacher sang pointedly.

The class sniggered.

"So, going back to SS Empire Duke....", the instructor declared gently.

The pupils listened in rapt attention.

The bell rang.

"That's all the time we have. I hope you learned something today," the educator said aggressively.

The pupils crowded out of the room timidly.

# Lesson 2: Teatro Farnese

"Greetings, class! Today we'll be covering Teatro Farnese," the lecturer said sullenly.

The students sat straighter in their seats.

The instructor sang robotically, "Teatro Farnese is a Renaissance -"

"What's Renaissance?" a student piped up quickly.

The schoolteacher paid no attention to the interruption and carried on.

The teacher seethed timidly, "- theatre in the Palazzo della Pilotta, Parma -"

"What's Parma?" a girl questioned gingerly.

The lecturer paid no attention to the interruption and carried on.

The professor said gently, "-, Italy -"

"What's Italy?" a pupil asked pointedly.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a smile.

The schoolteacher disregarded the interruption and carried on.

The lecturer seethed timidly, "-. It was built in 1618 by Giovanni Battista Aleotti -"

The educator took a breath, waiting for a question from the students about Giovanni Battista Aleotti or some other topic.

The lecturer continued.

The lecturer noted sullenly, "-. The idea of creating this grand theater came from the Duke of Parma and Piacenza Ranuccio I Farnese. The theatre was almost destroyed by an Allied air raid during World War II (1944). It was rebuilt and reopened in 1962. It is, along with the Teatro all'antica -"

"What's Teatro all'antica?" a boy piped up carefully.

The educator acknowledged the query with a smile.

The schoolteacher muttered mechanically, "The Teatro all'Antica ('Theater in the style of the ancients') is a theatre in Sabbioneta -"

"What's Sabbioneta?" a pupil questioned excitedly.

The educator ignored the interruption and proceeded.

The lecturer muttered timidly, "-, northern Italy; it was the first free-standing, purpose-built theater in the modern world. The Teatro all'Antica is the second-oldest surviving indoor theater in the world (after the Teatro Olimpico -"

"What's Teatro Olimpico?" a boy questioned.

The professor acknowledged the query with a grin.

The lecturer elaborated sullenly, "The Teatro Olimpico ('Olympic Theatre') is a theatre in Vicenza -"

"What's Vicenza?" a girl queried gingerly.

The teacher paid no attention to the interruption and proceeded.

The teacher breathed quietly, "-, northern Italy, constructed in 1580–1585. The theatre was the final design by the Italian Renaissance -"

"What's Italian Renaissance?" a girl piped up crudely.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The educator sang sullenly, "The Italian Renaissance -"

The professor took a breath, listening for a question from the students about Renaissance or some other topic.

The pupils suppressed giggles.

The schoolteacher continued.

The schoolteacher murmured quietly, "- (Italian: Rinascimento [rinaʃʃiˈmento]) was a period in Italian history that covered the 14th through the 17th centuries. The period is known for the development of a culture that spread across Europe and marked the transition from the Middle Ages -"

"What's Middle Ages?" a girl said sullenly.

The educator acknowledged the question with a grin.

The professor murmured excitedly, "In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted approximately from the 5th to the late 15th centuries, similarly to the Post-classical -"

The professor paused, expecting a query from the class about Post-classical or some other topic.

The pupils sat straighter in their seats.

The schoolteacher carried on.

The lecturer declared breathlessly, "- period of global history. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire -"

"What's Western Roman Empire?" a student questioned gingerly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a grin.

The educator explained confidently, "The Western Roman Empire -"

The lecturer paused, waiting for a query from the class about Roman Empire or some other topic.

The educator carried on.

The schoolteacher explained, "- comprises the western provinces of the Roman Empire at any time during which they were administered by a separate independent Imperial court; in particular, this term is used in historiography to describe the period from 395 to 476, where there were separate coequal courts dividing the governance of the empire in the Western and the Eastern provinces, with a distinct imperial succession in the separate courts. The terms Western Roman Empire and Eastern Roman Empire were coined in modern times to describe political entities that were de facto independent; contemporary Romans did not consider the Empire to have been split into two empires but viewed it as a single polity governed by two imperial courts as an administrative expediency. The Western Roman Empire collapsed in 476, and the Western imperial court in Ravenna -"

"What's Ravenna?" a girl raised calmly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a grin.

The educator seethed aggressively, "A raven is any of several larger-bodied species of the genus Corvus -"

The teacher halted, waiting for a question from the students about Corvus or some other topic.

The students suppressed giggles.

The lecturer continued.

The professor sang furiously, "-. These species do not form a single taxonomic group within the genus. There is no consistent distinction between 'crows' and 'ravens', and these appellations have been assigned to different species chiefly on the basis of their size. The largest raven species are the common raven and the thick-billed raven. The term 'raven' originally referred to the common raven (Corvus corax), the type species of the genus Corvus, which has a larger distribution than any other species of Corvus, ranging over much of the Northern Hemisphere -"

"What's Northern Hemisphere?" a boy questioned happily.

The professor acknowledged the question with a grin.

The schoolteacher elaborated breathlessly, "The North -"

"What's North?" a student demanded crudely.

The educator disregarded the interruption and carried on.

The educator noted gently, "-ern Hemisphere is the half of the Earth -"

"What's Earth?" a boy questioned.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a smile.

The teacher paid no heed to the interruption and carried on.

The instructor explained excitedly, "- that is north of the Equator. For other planets in the Solar System -"

"What's Solar System?" a girl blurted timidly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a smirk.

The schoolteacher said pointedly, "A star system or stellar system is a small number of stars that orbit each other, bound by gravitational attraction. A large group of stars bound by gravitation is generally called a star cluster or galaxy, although, broadly speaking, they are also star systems. Star systems are not to be confused with planetary systems, which include planets and similar bodies (such as comets). A star system of two stars is known as a binary star, binary star system or physical double star. If there are no tidal effects, no perturbation from other forces, and no transfer of mass from one star to the other, such a system is stable, and both stars will trace out an elliptical orbit around the barycenter of the system indefinitely. (See Two-body problem -"

The schoolteacher halted, expecting a question from the pupils about Two-body problem or some other topic.

The pupils sniggered.

The educator carried on.

The instructor murmured sadly, "-). Examples of binary systems are Sirius, Procyon and Cygnus X-1 -"

The professor paused, waiting for a query from the students about Cygnus X-1 or some other topic.

The students listened in rapt attention.

The lecturer continued.

The educator breathed sadly, "-, the last of which probably consists of a star and a black hole. A multiple star system consists of three or more stars that appear from Earth -"

"What's Earth?" a student blurted furiously.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a smile.

The schoolteacher ignored the interruption and continued.

The lecturer announced sadly, "- to be close to one another in the sky. This may result from the stars actually being physically close and gravitationally bound to each other, in which case it is a physical multiple star, or this closeness may be merely apparent, in which case it is an optical multiple star Physical multiple stars are also commonly called multiple stars or multiple star systems.Most multiple star systems are triple stars. System -"

"What's System?" a boy blurted pointedly.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a grin.

The educator seethed gingerly, "A system is a group of interacting or interrelated elements that act according to a set of rules to form a unified whole. A system, surrounded and influenced by its environment, is described by its boundaries, structure and purpose and expressed in its functioning. Systems are the subjects of study of systems theory. The term 'system' comes from the Latin -"

The teacher halted, anticipating a question from the pupils about Latin or some other topic.

The lecturer continued.

The instructor explained calmly, "- word systēma, in turn from Greek σύστημα systēma: 'whole concept made of several parts or members, system', literary 'composition'. According to Marshall McLuhan, 'System' means 'something to look at'. You must have a very high visual gradient to have systematization. But in philosophy, prior to Descartes, there was no 'system'. Plato had no 'system'. Aristotle had no 'system'. In the 19th century the French physicist Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot, who studied thermodynamics, pioneered the development of the concept of a 'system' in the natural sciences. In 1824 he studied the system which he called the working substance (typically a body of water vapor) in steam engines, in regards to the system's ability to do work when heat is applied to it. The working substance could be put in contact with either a boiler, a cold reservoir (a stream of cold water), or a piston (on which the working body could do work by pushing on it). In 1850, the German physicist Rudolf Clausius -"

"What's Rudolf Clausius?" a boy raised politely.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The teacher said sadly, "Rudolf Julius Emanuel Clausius -"

"What's Clausius?" a boy queried robotically.

The professor acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The lecturer muttered breathlessly, "Rudolf Julius Emanuel Clausius -"

"What's Clausius?" a boy quizzed mechanically.

The professor acknowledged the question with a grin.

The schoolteacher noted aggressively, "Rudolf Julius Emanuel Clausius (German pronunciation: [ˈʁuːdɔlf ˈklaʊ̯zi̯ʊs]; 2 January 1822 – 24 August 1888) was a German physicist and mathematician and is considered one of the central founders of the science of thermodynamics. By his restatement of Sadi Carnot's principle known as the Carnot cycle -"

"What's Carnot cycle?" a pupil questioned calmly.

The lecturer paid no heed to the interruption and proceeded.

The educator announced quickly, "-, he gave the theory of heat a truer and sounder basis. His most important paper, 'On the Moving Force of Heat -"

The teacher paused, anticipating a question from the students about Heat or some other topic.

The students sniggered.

The educator carried on.

The educator said gingerly, "-', published in 1850, first stated the basic ideas of the second law of thermodynamics. In 1865 he introduced the concept of entropy. In 1870 he introduced the virial theorem, which applied to heat. Clausius was born in Köslin (now Koszalin, Poland) in the Province of Pomerania in Prussia -"

"What's Prussia?" a girl questioned happily.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The teacher seethed gingerly, "Russia (Russian: Россия, Rossiya, Russian pronunciation: [rɐˈsʲijə]), or the Russian Federation, is a transcontinental country spanning Eastern Europe -"

"What's Eastern Europe?" a pupil blurted crudely.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a nod.

The lecturer breathed gently, "Western Europe -"

"What's Europe?" a girl questioned confidently.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The lecturer explained happily, "Euro -"

"What's Euro?" a student questioned gently.

The teacher disregarded the interruption and carried on.

The teacher sang crudely, "-pe is a landmass located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere -"

"What's Northern Hemisphere?" a boy quizzed crudely.

The instructor paid no attention to the interruption and carried on.

The educator seethed carefully, "- and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere. It comprises the westernmost peninsulas of the continental landmass of Eurasia, it shares the continental landmass of Afro-Eurasia -"

"What's Afro-Eurasia?" a student wondered excitedly.

The educator acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The schoolteacher paid no heed to the interruption and carried on.

The teacher said sullenly, "- with both Asia -"

The professor took a breath, expecting a query from the students about Asia or some other topic.

The students sniggered.

The teacher proceeded.

The teacher said happily, "- and Africa -"

"What's Africa?" a pupil piped up politely.

The instructor paid no heed to the interruption and proceeded.

The teacher murmured timidly, "- and is bordered by the Arctic Ocean -"

"What's Arctic Ocean?" a student wondered pointedly.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a smirk.

The instructor breathed carefully, "The Arctic -"

"What's Arctic?" a boy said robotically.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a smile.

The instructor disregarded the interruption and continued.

The professor elaborated confidently, "- Ocean is the smallest and shallowest of the world's five major oceans. It spans an area of approximately 14,060,000 km2 (5,430,000 sq mi) and is also known as the coldest of all the oceans. The International Hydrographic Organization -"

The lecturer halted, listening for a question from the class about International Hydrographic Organization or some other topic.

The pupils listened in rapt attention.

The teacher proceeded.

The schoolteacher murmured aggressively, "- (IHO) recognizes it as an ocean, although some oceanographers call it the Arctic Mediterranean Sea -"

"What's Sea?" a pupil said gently.

The educator disregarded the interruption and carried on.

The educator explained pointedly, "-. It has been described approximately as an estuary of the Atlantic Ocean -"

The educator took a breath, waiting for a query from the pupils about Atlantic Ocean or some other topic.

"What's North?" a boy raised politely.

The educator acknowledged the question with a smirk.

The schoolteacher explained gently, "Birth is the act or process of bearing or bringing forth offspring, also referred to in technical contexts as parturition. In mammals, the process is initiated by hormones which cause the muscular walls of the uterus to contract, expelling the fetus at a developmental stage when it is ready to feed and breathe. In some species the offspring is precocial and can move around almost immediately after birth but in others it is altricial and completely dependent on parenting. In marsupials, the fetus is born at a very immature stage after a short gestational period and develops further in its mother's womb's pouch. It is not only mammals that give birth. Some reptiles, amphibians, fish and invertebrates carry their developing young inside them. Some of these are ovoviviparous, with the eggs being hatched inside the mother's body, and others are viviparous, with the embryo developing inside her body, as in the case of mammals. Large mammals, such as primates, cattle, horses, some antelopes, giraffes, hippopotamuses, rhinoceroses, elephants, seals, whales, dolphins, and porpoises, generally are pregnant with one offspring at a time, although they may have twin or multiple births on occasion. In these large animals, the birth process is similar to that of a human, though in most the offspring is precocial. This means that it is born in a more advanced state than a human baby and is able to stand, walk and run (or swim in the case of an aquatic mammal) shortly after birth.In the case of whales, dolphins and porpoises, the single calf is normally born tail first which minimizes the risk of drowning. The mother encourages the newborn calf to rise to the surface of the water to breathe.Most smaller mammals have multiple births, producing litters of young which may number twelve or more. In these animals, each fetus is surrounded by its own amniotic sac and has a separate placenta. This separates from the wall of the uterus during labor and the fetus works its way towards the birth canal.Large mammals which give birth to twins is much more rare, but it does occur occasionally even for mammals as large as elephants. In April 2018, approximately 8-month old elephant twins were sighted joining their mother's herd in the Tarangire National Park of Tanzania, estimated to have been born in August 2017. Humans usually produce a single offspring at a time. The mother's body is prepared for birth by hormones produced by the pituitary gland, the ovary and the placenta. The total gestation period from fertilization to birth is normally about 38 weeks (birth usually occurring 40 weeks after the last menstrual period). The normal process of childbirth takes several hours and has three stages. The first stage starts with a series of involuntary contractions of the muscular walls of the uterus and gradual dilation of the cervix. The active phase of the first stage starts when the cervix is dilated more than about 4 cm in diameter and is when the contractions become stronger and regular. The head (or the buttocks in a breech birth) of the baby is pushed against the cervix, which gradually dilates until is fully dilated at 10 cm diameter. At some time, the amniotic sac bursts and the amniotic fluid escapes (also known as rupture of membranes or breaking the water). In stage two, starting when the cervix is fully dilated, strong contractions of the uterus and active pushing by the mother expels the baby out through the vagina, which during this stage of labour is called a birth canal as this passage contains a baby, and the baby is born with umbilical cord attached. In stage three, which begins after the birth of the baby, further contractions expel the placenta, amniotic sac, and the remaining portion of the umbilical cord usually within a few minutes.Enormous changes take place in the newborn's circulation to enable breathing in air. In the uterus, the unborn baby is dependent on circulation of blood through the placenta for sustenance including gaseous exchange and the unborn baby's blood bypasses the lungs by flowing through the foramen ovale, which is a hole in the septum dividing the right atrium and left atrium. After birth the umbilical cord is clamped and cut, the baby starts to breathe air, and blood from the right ventricle starts to flow to the lungs for gaseous exchange and oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium, which is pumped into the left ventricle, and then pumped into the main arterial system. As a result of these changes, the blood pressure in the left atrium exceeds the pressure in the right atrium, and this pressure difference forces the foramen ovale to close separating the left and right sides of the heart. The umbilical vein, umbilical arteries, ductus venosus and ductus arteriosus are not needed for life in air and in time these vessels become ligaments (embryonic remnants). A birth on board in mid-flight was declared in Airbus A321 -"

# Lesson 3: Michael Landsberry

"Hello, class! Today we'll be covering Michael Landsberry," the instructor announced sadly.

The class listened in rapt attention.

The teacher explained furiously, "Michael Terrence Landsberry (January 20, 1968 – October 21, 2013) was an American math teacher, and Afghanistan war Marine. During the Sparks Middle School shooting -"

"What's Sparks Middle School shooting?" a student said crudely.

The instructor paid no heed to the interruption and carried on.

The lecturer breathed robotically, "-, he unsuccessfully attempted to reason with the shooter, Jose Reyes, before being shot and killed. Landsberry was born in Birmingham, Alabama -"

"What's Birmingham, Alabama?" a boy queried crudely.

The educator acknowledged the question with a nod.

The educator declared crudely, "Birmingham -"

The schoolteacher looked around, expecting a query from the class about Birmingham or some other topic.

The students stifled their yawns.

The lecturer carried on.

The instructor murmured excitedly, "- ( BUR-ming-ham) is a city in the north central region of the U.S. state of Alabama -"

The teacher halted, anticipating a query from the class about Alabama or some other topic.

The class suppressed giggles.

The schoolteacher carried on.

The teacher announced mechanically, "-. Birmingham is the seat of Jefferson County, Alabama -"

"What's Jefferson County, Alabama?" a boy questioned confidently.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a smile.

The lecturer announced excitedly, "Jefferson County is the most populous county in the U.S. state -"

"What's Alabama?" a pupil said gingerly.

The teacher paid no attention to the interruption and continued.

The teacher murmured mechanically, "-, located in the central portion of the state. As of the 2020 census, its population was 674,721. Its county seat is Birmingham. Its rapid growth as an industrial city in the 20th century, based on heavy manufacturing in steel and iron, established its dominance. Jefferson County is the central county of the Birmingham-Hoover, AL Metropolitan Statistical Area. In 2011, Jefferson County was $4.2 billion in debt and declared bankruptcy. The financial problems were related to costs of a huge sewer project. Corruption charges were adjudicated against six county commissioners. This was the largest Chapter 9 (municipal) bankruptcy in the United States -"

The lecturer looked around, expecting a query from the class about United States or some other topic.

The teacher continued.

The schoolteacher said crudely, "-, until it was surpassed by that of Detroit, Michigan in 2013. Jefferson County emerged from bankruptcy in December 2013, following the approval of a bankruptcy plan by the United States bankruptcy court -"

"What's United States bankruptcy court?" a pupil questioned slowly.

"What's Washington, D.C.?" a boy questioned quickly.

The instructor ignored the interruption and continued.

The educator murmured calmly, "- Both senators and representatives are chosen through direct election, though vacancies in the Senate may be filled by a governor's appointment. Congress has 535 voting members: 100 senators and 435 representatives. The Vice President of the United States -"

"What's Vice President of the United States?" a girl said calmly.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The teacher seethed breathlessly, "The vice president of the United States -"

The schoolteacher looked around, expecting a query from the pupils about United States or some other topic.

The instructor proceeded.

The schoolteacher muttered furiously, "- (VPOTUS) is the second-highest officer in the executive branch of the U.S. federal government, after the president of the United States, and ranks first in the presidential line of succession. The vice president is also an officer in the legislative branch, as the president of the Senate. In this capacity, the vice president is empowered to preside over Senate deliberations at any time, but may not vote except to cast a tie-breaking vote. The vice president is indirectly elected together with the president to a four-year term of office by the people of the United States through the Electoral College.The modern vice presidency is a position of significant power and is widely seen as an integral part of a president's administration. While the exact nature of the role varies in each administration, most modern vice presidents serve as a key presidential advisor, governing partner, and representative of the president. The vice president is also a statutory member of the National Security Council and thus plays a significant role in national security matters. As the vice president's role within the executive branch has expanded, the legislative branch role has contracted; for example, vice presidents now preside over the Senate only infrequently.The role of the vice presidency has changed dramatically since the office was created during the 1787 Constitutional Convention. Originally something of an afterthought, the vice presidency was considered an insignificant office for much of the nation's history, especially after the Twelfth Amendment meant that vice presidents were no longer the runners-up in the presidential election. The vice president's role began steadily growing in importance during the 1930s, with the Office of the Vice President being created in the executive branch in 1939, and has since grown much further. Due to its increase in power and prestige, the vice presidency is now often considered to be a stepping stone to the presidency. Since the 1970s, the vice president has been afforded an official residence at Number One Observatory Circle. The Constitution does not expressly assign the vice presidency to a branch of the government, causing a dispute among scholars about which branch the office belongs to (the executive, the legislative, both, or neither). The modern view of the vice president as an officer of the executive branch—one isolated almost totally from the legislative branch—is due in large part to the assignment of executive authority to the vice president by either the president or Congress. Nevertheless, modern vice presidents have often previously served in Congress, and are often tasked with helping to advance an administration's legislative priorities. Kamala Harris -"

"What's Kamala Harris?" a pupil queried furiously.

The educator acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The teacher paid no heed to the interruption and proceeded.

The schoolteacher seethed timidly, "- is the 49th and current vice president of the United States. She is the first African American, first Asian American, and first female occupant of the office. She assumed office on January 20, 2021. No mention of an office of vice president was made at the 1787 Constitutional Convention until near the end, when an eleven-member committee on 'Leftover Business' proposed a method of electing the chief executive (president). Delegates had previously considered the selection of the Senate's presiding officer, deciding that 'the Senate shall choose its own President,' and had agreed that this official would be designated the executive's immediate successor. They had also considered the mode of election of the executive but had not reached consensus. This all changed on September 4, when the committee recommended that the nation's chief executive be elected by an Electoral College, with each state having a number of presidential electors equal to the sum of that state's allocation of representatives and senators.Recognizing that loyalty to one's individual state outweighed loyalty to the new federation, the Constitution's framers assumed individual electors would be inclined to choose a candidate from their own state (a so-called 'favorite son' candidate) over one from another state. So they created the office of vice president and required the electors to vote for two candidates, at least one of whom must be from outside the elector's state, believing that the second vote would be cast for a candidate of national character. Additionally, to guard against the possibility that electors might strategically waste their second votes, it was specified that the first runner-up would become vice president.The resultant method of electing the president and vice president, spelled out in Article II, Section 1, Clause 3, allocated to each state a number of electors equal to the combined total of its Senate and House of Representatives membership. Each elector was allowed to vote for two people for president (rather than for both president and vice president), but could not differentiate between their first and second choice for the presidency. The person receiving the greatest number of votes (provided it was an absolute majority of the whole number of electors) would be president, while the individual who received the next largest number of votes became vice president. If there were a tie for first or for second place, or if no one won a majority of votes, the president and vice president would be selected by means of contingent elections protocols stated in the clause. The first two vice presidents, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson -"

"What's Thomas Jefferson?" a student quizzed sullenly.

The instructor acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The lecturer paid no attention to the interruption and carried on.

The instructor declared slowly, "- are associated with specific Native American nations, often on a one-to-one basis. Some of the country's 574 federally recognized tribes govern more than one reservation, while some share reservations, and others have no reservation at all. In addition, because of past land allotments, leading to sales to non–Native Americans, some reservations are severely fragmented, with each piece of tribal, individual, and privately held land being a separate enclave. This jumble of private and public real estate creates significant administrative, political and legal difficulties.The collective geographical area of all reservations is 56,200,000 acres (22,700,000 ha; 87,800 sq mi; 227,000 km2), approximately the size of the state of Idaho -"

"What's Idaho?" a girl blurted confidently.

The professor paid no heed to the interruption and proceeded.

The schoolteacher noted excitedly, "-. While most reservations are small compared to U.S. states, there are twelve Indian reservations larger than the state of Rhode Island. The largest reservation, the Navajo Nation -"

The tribe's name (natively kką:ze) is often said to mean 'people of the (south) wind' although this was probably not the term's original meaning. For thousands of years, what is now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes. Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys. Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of bison. The first Euro-American settlement in Kansas occurred in 1827 at Fort Leavenworth -"

The lecturer paid no attention to the interruption and proceeded.

The professor muttered carefully, "- metropolitan area and is the largest city within the greater Mojave Desert -"

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The lecturer breathed sadly, "The Mojave Desert -"

"What's Desert?" a girl raised happily.

The educator acknowledged the query with a nod.

The professor murmured sullenly, "A desert is a barren area of landscape where little precipitation occurs and, consequently, living conditions are hostile for plant and animal life. The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to the processes of denudation. About one-third of the land surface of the Earth is arid or semi-arid. This includes much of the polar regions, where little precipitation occurs, and which are sometimes called polar deserts or 'cold deserts'. Deserts can be classified by the amount of precipitation that falls, by the temperature that prevails, by the causes of desertification or by their geographical location. Deserts are formed by weathering processes as large variations in temperature between day and night put strains on the rocks, which consequently break in pieces. Although rain seldom occurs in deserts, there are occasional downpours that can result in flash floods. Rain falling on hot rocks can cause them to shatter, and the resulting fragments and rubble strewn over the desert floor are further eroded by the wind. This picks up particles of sand and dust, which can remain airborne for extended periods – sometimes causing the formation of sand storms or dust storms. Wind-blown sand grains striking any solid object in their path can abrade the surface. Rocks are smoothed down, and the wind sorts sand into uniform deposits. The grains end up as level sheets of sand or are piled high in billowing sand dunes. Other deserts are flat, stony plains where all the fine material has been blown away and the surface consists of a mosaic of smooth stones. These areas are known as desert pavements, and little further erosion takes place. Other desert features include rock outcrops, exposed bedrock and clays once deposited by flowing water. Temporary lakes may form and salt pans may be left when waters evaporate. There may be underground sources of water, in the form of springs and seepages from aquifers. Where these are found, oases can occur. Plants and animals living in the desert need special adaptations to survive in the harsh environment. Plants tend to be tough and wiry with small or no leaves, water-resistant cuticles, and often spines to deter herbivory. Some annual plants germinate, bloom and die in the course of a few weeks after rainfall, while other long-lived plants survive for years and have deep root systems able to tap underground moisture. Animals need to keep cool and find enough food and water to survive. Many are nocturnal, and stay in the shade or underground during the heat of the day. They tend to be efficient at conserving water, extracting most of their needs from their food and concentrating their urine. Some animals remain in a state of dormancy for long periods, ready to become active again during the rare rainfall. They then reproduce rapidly while conditions are favorable before returning to dormancy. People have struggled to live in deserts and the surrounding semi-arid lands for millennia. Nomad -"

"What's Nomad?" a pupil queried slowly.

The educator acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The educator announced furiously, "A nomad (Middle French: nomade 'people with fixed habitation') is a member of a community without fixed habitation which regularly moves to and from the same areas. Such groups include hunter-gatherers, pastoral nomads (owning livestock), and tinkers or trader nomads. In the twentieth century, population of nomadic pastoral tribes slowly decreased, reaching to an estimated 30–40 million nomads in the world as of 1995.Nomadic hunting and gathering—following seasonally available wild plants and game—is by far the oldest human subsistence method. Pastoralists raise herds, driving or accompanying in patterns that normally avoid depleting pastures beyond their ability to recover.Nomadism is also a lifestyle adapted to infertile regions such as steppe, tundra, or ice and sand, where mobility is the most efficient strategy for exploiting scarce resources. For example, many groups living in the tundra are reindeer herders and are semi-extra nomadic, following forage for their animals. Sometimes also described as 'nomadic' are the various itinerant populations who move among densely populated areas to offer specialized services (crafts or trades) to their residents—external consultants, for example. These groups are known as 'peripatetic nomads'. A nomad is a person with no settled home, moving from place to place as a way of obtaining food, finding pasture for livestock, or otherwise making a living. The word 'nomad' comes ultimately from the classical Greek word νομάς (nomás, 'roaming, wandering, especially to find pasture'), from Ancient Greek νομός (nomós, 'pasture'). Most nomadic groups follow a fixed annual or seasonal pattern of movements and settlements. Nomadic peoples traditionally travel by animal or canoe or on foot. Animals include camels, horses and alpaca. Today, some nomads travel by motor vehicle. Some nomads may live in homes or homeless shelters, though this would necessarily be on a temporary or itinerant basis.Nomads keep moving for different reasons. Nomadic foragers move in search of game, edible plants, and water. Aboriginal Australians, Negritos of Southeast Asia, and San of Africa, for example, traditionally move from camp to camp to hunt and gather wild plants. Some tribes of the Americas followed this way of life. Pastoral nomads, on the other hand, make their living raising livestock such as camels, cattle, goats, horses, sheep, or yaks; these nomads usually travel in search of pastures for their flocks.

# Lesson 4: Propionaldehyde

"Hello, class! Today we'll be discussing Propionaldehyde," the educator breathed breathlessly.

The class listened in rapt attention.

The lecturer seethed quietly, "Propionaldehyde or propanal is the organic compound with the formula CH3CH2CHO. It is the 3-carbon aldehyde. It is a colourless, flammable liquid with a slightly fruity odour. It is produced on a large scale industrially. Propionaldehyde is mainly produced industrially by hydroformylation of ethylene: CO + H2 + C2H4 → CH3CH2CHOIn this way, several hundred thousand tons are produced annually. Propionaldehyde may also be prepared by oxidizing 1-propanol -"

"What's 1-propanol?" a pupil quizzed pointedly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the query with a smile.

The schoolteacher said, "1-Propanol is a primary alcohol with the formula CH3CH2CH2OH and sometimes represented as PrOH or n-PrOH. It is a colorless liquid and an isomer of 2-propanol -"

"What's 2-propanol?" a girl piped up timidly.

The instructor acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The professor elaborated sullenly, "Isopropyl alcohol (IUPAC name propan-2-ol and also called isopropanol or 2-propanol) is a colorless, flammable chemical compound (chemical formula CH3CHOHCH3) with a strong odor. As an isopropyl group linked to a hydroxyl group, it is the simplest example of a secondary alcohol, where the alcohol carbon atom is attached to two other carbon atoms. It is a structural isomer of 1-propanol and ethyl methyl ether. It is used in the manufacture of a wide variety of industrial and household chemicals and is a common ingredient in chemicals such as antiseptics, disinfectants, and detergents. Isopropyl alcohol is miscible in water, ethanol, ether, and chloroform. It dissolves ethyl cellulose, polyvinyl butyral, many oils, alkaloids, gums and natural resins. Unlike ethanol or methanol, isopropyl alcohol is not miscible with salt solutions and can be separated from aqueous solutions by adding a salt such as sodium chloride. The process is colloquially called salting out, and causes concentrated isopropyl alcohol to separate into a distinct layer.Isopropyl alcohol forms an azeotrope with water, which gives a boiling point of 80.37 °C (176.67 °F) and a composition of 87.7% by mass (91% by volume) isopropyl alcohol. Water -"

"What's Water?" a girl quizzed quietly.

The lecturer paid no attention to the interruption and continued.

The teacher muttered gently, "-–isopropyl alcohol mixtures have depressed melting points. It has a slightly bitter taste, and is not safe to drink.Isopropyl alcohol becomes increasingly viscous with decreasing temperature and freezes at −89 °C (−128 °F). Isopropyl alcohol has a maximal absorbance at 205 nm in an ultraviolet–visible spectrum. Isopropyl alcohol can be oxidized to acetone, which is the corresponding ketone. This can be achieved using oxidizing agents such as chromic acid, or by dehydrogenation of isopropyl alcohol over a heated copper catalyst: (CH3)2CHOH → (CH3)2CO + H2Isopropyl alcohol is often used as both solvent and hydride source in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction -"

"What's Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction?" a girl said pointedly.

The lecturer ignored the interruption and continued.

The lecturer announced happily, "- and other transfer hydrogenation reactions. Isopropyl alcohol may be converted to 2-bromopropane using phosphorus tribromide, or dehydrated to propene by heating with sulfuric acid. Like most alcohols, isopropyl alcohol reacts with active metals such as potassium to form alkoxides that can be called isopropoxides. The reaction with aluminium (initiated by a trace of mercury) is used to prepare the catalyst aluminium isopropoxide. In 1920, Standard Oil -"

"What's Standard Oil?" a girl quizzed gently.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a smirk.

The teacher paid no heed to the interruption and proceeded.

The lecturer muttered slowly, "- first produced isopropyl alcohol by hydrating propene. Isopropyl alcohol was oxidized to acetone for the preparation of cordite, a smokeless, low explosive propellant. In 1994, 1.5 million tonnes of isopropyl alcohol were produced in the United States, Europe, and Japan. It is primarily produced by combining water and propene in a hydration reaction or by hydrogenating acetone. There are two routes for the hydration process and both processes require that the isopropyl alcohol be separated from water and other by-products by distillation. Isopropyl alcohol and water form an azeotrope, and simple distillation gives a material that is 87.9% by mass isopropyl alcohol and 12.1% by mass water. Pure (anhydrous) isopropyl alcohol is made by azeotropic distillation of the wet isopropyl alcohol using either diisopropyl ether or cyclohexane as azeotroping agents. Small amounts of isopropyl alcohol are produced in the body in diabetic ketoacidosis. Indirect hydration reacts propene with sulfuric acid to form a mixture of sulfate esters. This process can use low-quality propene, and is predominant in the USA. These processes give primarily isopropyl alcohol rather than 1-propanol, because adding water or sulfuric acid to propene follows Markovnikov's rule -"

"What's Markovnikov's rule?" a boy raised pointedly.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a smile.

The schoolteacher sang pointedly, "In organic chemistry, Markovnikov's rule or Markownikoff's rule describes the outcome of some addition reactions. The rule was formulated by Russian chemist Vladimir Markovnikov -"

The educator looked around, anticipating a question from the class about Vladimir Markovnikov or some other topic.

The class suppressed giggles.

The teacher continued.

The professor explained excitedly, "- in 1870. The rule states that with the addition of a protic acid HX or other polar reagent to an asymmetric alkene, the acid hydrogen (H) or electropositive part gets attached to the carbon with more hydrogen substituents, and the halide (X) group or electronegative part gets attached to the carbon with more alkyl substituents. This is in contrast to Markovnikov's original definition, in which the rule is stated that the X component is added to the carbon with the fewest hydrogen atoms while the hydrogen atom is added to the carbon with the greatest number of hydrogen atoms. The same is true when an alkene reacts with water in an addition reaction to form an alcohol which involve formation of carbocations. The hydroxyl group (OH) bonds to the carbon that has the greater number of carbon–carbon bonds, while the hydrogen bonds to the carbon on the other end of the double bond, that has more carbon–hydrogen bonds. The chemical basis for Markovnikov's Rule is the formation of the most stable carbocation during the addition process. The addition of the hydrogen ion to one carbon atom in the alkene creates a positive charge on the other carbon, forming a carbocation intermediate. The more substituted the carbocation, the more stable it is, due to induction and hyperconjugation. The major product of the addition reaction will be the one formed from the more stable intermediate. Therefore, the major product of the addition of HX (where X is some atom more electronegative than H) to an alkene has the hydrogen atom in the less substituted position and X in the more substituted position. But the other less substituted, less stable carbocation will still be formed at some concentration, and will proceed to be the minor product with the opposite, conjugate attachment of X. Mechanisms that do not involve a carbocation intermediate may react through other mechanisms that have other regioselectivities not dictated by Markovnikov's rule, such as free radical addition. Such reactions are said to be anti-Markovnikov, since the halogen adds to the less substituted carbon, the opposite of a Markovnikov reaction. The anti-Markovnikov rule can be illustrated using the addition of hydrogen bromide to isobutylene in the presence of benzoyl peroxide or hydrogen peroxide. The reaction of HBr with substituted alkenes was prototypical in the study of free-radical additions. Early chemists discovered that the reason for the variability in the ratio of Markovnikov to anti-Markovnikov reaction products was due to the unexpected presence of free radical ionizing substances such as peroxides. The explanation is that the O-O bond in peroxides is relatively weak. With the aid of light, heat, or sometimes even just acting on its own, the O-O bond can split to form 2 radicals. The radical groups can then interact with HBr to produce a Br radical, which then reacts with the double bond. Since the bromine atom is relatively large, it is more likely to encounter and react with the least substituted carbon since this interaction produces less static interactions between the carbon and the bromine radical. Furthermore, similar to a positive charged species, the radical species is most stable when the unpaired electron is in the more substituted position. The radical intermediate is stabilized by hyperconjugation. In the more substituted position, more carbon-hydrogen bonds are aligned with the radical's electron deficient molecular orbital. This means that there are greater hyperconjugation effects, so that position is more favorable. In this case, the terminal carbon is a reactant that produces a primary addition product instead of a secondary addition product. A new method of anti-Markovnikov addition has been described by Hamilton and Nicewicz, who utilize aromatic molecules and light energy from a low-energy diode to turn the alkene into a cation radical.Anti-Markovnikov behaviour extends to more chemical reactions than additions to alkenes. Anti-Markovnikov behaviour is observed in the hydration of phenylacetylene by auric catalysis, which gives acetophenone; although with a special ruthenium catalyst it provides the other regioisomer 2-phenylacetaldehyde: Anti-Markovnikov behavior can also manifest itself in certain rearrangement reactions. In a titanium(IV) chloride-catalyzed formal nucleophilic substitution at enantiopure 1 in the scheme below, two products are formed – 2a and 2b Due to the two chiral centers in the target molecule, the carbon carrying chlorine and the carbon carrying the methyl and acetoxyethyl group, four different compounds are to be formed: 1R,2R- (drawn as 2b) 1R,2S- 1S,2R- (drawn as 2a) and 1S,2S- . Therefore, both of the depicted structures will exist in a D- and an L-form. : This product distribution can be rationalized by assuming that loss of the hydroxy group in 1 gives the tertiary carbocation A, which rearranges to the seemingly less stable secondary carbocation B. Chlorine can approach this center from two faces leading to the observed mixture of isomers. Another notable example of anti-Markovnikov addition is hydroboration. Zaitsev's rule -"

"What's Zaitsev's rule?" a student blurted confidently.

The professor acknowledged the question with a grin.

The professor elaborated pointedly, "In organic chemistry, Zaitsev's rule (or Saytzeff's rule, Saytzev's rule) is an empirical rule for predicting the favored alkene product(s) in elimination reactions. While at the University of Kazan, Russian chemist Alexander Zaitsev studied a variety of different elimination reactions and observed a general trend in the resulting alkenes. Based on this trend, Zaitsev stated, 'The alkene formed in greatest amount isthat corresponds to removal of the hydrogen from the alpha-carbon having the fewest hydrogen substituents.' For example, when 2-iodobutane is treated with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH), 2-butene -"

"What's 2-butene?" a student said slowly.

The instructor paid no heed to the interruption and proceeded.

The teacher sang robotically, "- is the major product and 1-butene -"

"What's 1-butene?" a student raised furiously.

The instructor paid no attention to the interruption and carried on.

The schoolteacher declared gently, "- is the minor product. More generally, Zaitsev's rule predicts that in an elimination reaction, the most substituted product will be the most stable, and therefore the most favored. The rule makes no generalizations about the stereochemistry of the newly formed alkene, but only the regiochemistry of the elimination reaction. While effective at predicting the favored product for many elimination reactions, Zaitsev's rule is subject to many exceptions. Many of them include exceptions under Hoffman product (analogous to Zaitsev product). These include compounds having quarternary nitrogen and leaving groups like NR3+,SO3H, etc. In these eliminations the Hoffman product is preferred. In case the leaving group is halogens,except fluorine; others give Zaitsev product. Alexander Zaitsev first published his observations regarding the products of elimination reactions in Justus Liebigs Annalen -"

"What's Liebigs Annalen?" a girl said breathlessly.

The professor acknowledged the query with a nod.

The field of navigation includes four general categories: land navigation, marine navigation, aeronautic navigation, and space navigation.It is also the term of art used for the specialized knowledge used by navigators to perform navigation tasks. All navigational techniques involve locating the navigator's position compared to known locations or patterns. Navigation, in a broader sense, can refer to any skill or study that involves the determination of position and direction. In this sense, navigation includes orienteering and pedestrian navigation. In the European medieval period, navigation was considered part of the set of seven mechanical arts, none of which were used for long voyages across open ocean. Polynesian navigation is probably the earliest form of open-ocean navigation, it was based on memory and observation recorded on scientific instruments like the Marshall Islands Stick Charts of Ocean Swells. Early Pacific Polynesians used the motion of stars, weather, the position of certain wildlife species, or the size of waves to find the path from one island to another. Maritime navigation using scientific instruments such as the mariner's astrolabe first occurred in the Mediterranean during the Middle Ages. Although land astrolabes were invented in the Hellenistic period -"

In the broadest sense, it is the land-based military branch, service branch or armed service of a nation or state. It may also include aviation assets by possessing an army aviation component. Within a national military force, the word army may also mean a field army. In some countries, such as France and China, the term 'army', especially in its plural form 'armies', has the broader meaning of armed forces as a whole, while retaining the colloquial sense of land forces. To differentiate the colloquial army from the formal concept of military force, the term is qualified, for example in France the land force is called Armée de terre, meaning Land Army, and the air and space force is called Armée de l'Air et de l’Espace, meaning Air and Space Army. The naval force, although not using the term 'army', is also included in the broad sense of the term 'armies' — thus the French Navy -"

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The teacher declared breathlessly, "West is one of the four cardinal directions or points of the compass. It is the opposite direction from East and is the direction in which the sun sets. The word 'west' is a Germanic word passed into some Romance languages -"

The teacher paused, listening for a query from the pupils about Romance languages or some other topic.

The instructor carried on.

The professor announced happily, "- (ouest in French, oest in Catalan, ovest in Italian, oeste in Spanish and Portuguese). As in other languages, the word formation stems from the fact that west is the direction of the setting sun in the evening: 'west' derives from the Indo-European root *wes reduced from *wes-pero 'evening, night', cognate with Ancient Greek ἕσπερος hesperos 'evening; evening star; western' and Latin vesper 'evening; west'. Examples of the same formation in other languages include Latin occidens 'west' from occidō 'to go down, to set' and Hebrew מַעֲרָב maarav 'west' from עֶרֶב erev 'evening'. To go west using a compass for navigation (in a place where magnetic north is the same direction as true north) one needs to set a bearing or azimuth of 270°. West is the direction opposite that of the Earth -"

For tropical cyclone warning purposes, the northern Pacific is divided into three regions: the eastern (North America to 140°W), central (140°W to 180°), and western (180° to 100°E), while the southern Pacific is divided into 2 sections, the Australian region (90E to 160°E) and the southern Pacific basin between 160°E and 120°W. Identical phenomena in the western north Pacific are called typhoons. This separation between the two basins has a practical convenience, however, as tropical cyclones rarely form in the central north Pacific due to high vertical wind shear, and few cross the dateline. Documentation of Pacific hurricanes dates to the Spanish colonization of Mexico -"

In a federation, the self-governing status of the component states, as well as the division of power between them and the central government, is typically constitutionally entrenched and may not be altered by a unilateral decision of either party, the states or the federal political body. Alternatively, a federation is a form of government in which sovereign power is formally divided between a central authority and a number of constituent regions so that each region retains some degree of control over its internal affairs. It is often argued that federal states where the central government has overriding powers are not truly federal states. For example, such overriding powers may include: the constitutional authority to suspend a constituent state's government by invoking gross mismanagement or civil unrest, or to adopt national legislation that overrides or infringes on the constituent states' powers by invoking the central government's constitutional authority to ensure 'peace and good government' or to implement obligations contracted under an international treaty. The governmental or constitutional structure found in a federation is considered to be federalist, or to be an example of federalism. It can be considered the opposite of another system, the unitary state. France, for example, has been unitary for many centuries. Austria and its Länder -"

"What's Länder?" a boy piped up crudely.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The schoolteacher declared gingerly, "Länder (singular Land) or Bundesländer (singular Bundesland) is the name for (federal) states in two German-speaking countries. It may more specifically refer to: States of Austria -"

"What's States of Austria?" a pupil quizzed mechanically.

The professor ignored the interruption and carried on.

The instructor sang happily, "-, the nine federal subdivisions of Austria States of Germany -"

The class stifled their yawns.

The schoolteacher continued.

The professor breathed slowly, "-; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger.The term burger can also be applied to the meat patty on its own, especially in the United Kingdom, where the term patty is rarely used, or the term can even refer simply to ground beef. Since the term hamburger usually implies beef, for clarity burger may be prefixed with the type of meat or meat substitute used, as in beef burger, turkey burger, bison burger, portobello burger, or veggie burger. Hamburgers are typically sold at fast-food restaurants, diners, and specialty and high-end restaurants. There are many international and regional variations of hamburgers. The term hamburger originally derives from Hamburg, Germany -"

"What's Germany?" a student piped up confidently.

The educator paid no attention to the interruption and continued.

The lecturer murmured happily, "-'s second-largest city. Hamburger in German is the demonym of Hamburg, similar to frankfurter and wiener, names for other meat-based foods and demonyms of the cities of Frankfurt -"

The lecturer looked around, expecting a question from the class about Frankfurt or some other topic.

The teacher continued.

The educator noted pointedly, "- and Vienna (in German Wien) respectively. By back-formation, the term 'burger' eventually became a self-standing word that is associated with many different types of sandwiches, similar to a (ground meat) hamburger, but made of different meats such as buffalo in the buffalo burger, venison, kangaroo, chicken, turkey, elk, lamb or fish like salmon in the salmon burger, but even with meatless sandwiches as is the case of the veggie burger. As versions of the meal have been served for over a century, its origin remains ambiguous. The popular book The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy -"

"What's The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy?" a boy asked confidently.

The instructor acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The educator elaborated calmly, "The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy is a cookbook by Hannah Glasse -"

"What's Hannah Glasse?" a girl piped up pointedly.

The schoolteacher paid no heed to the interruption and continued.

The educator said carefully, "- (1708–1770) first published in 1747. It was a bestseller for a century after its first publication, dominating the English-speaking market and making Glasse one of the most famous cookbook authors of her time. The book ran through at least 40 editions, many of which were copied without explicit author consent. It was published in Dublin from 1748, and in America from 1805. Glasse said in her note 'To the Reader' that she used plain language so that servants would be able to understand it. The 1751 edition was the first book to mention trifle with jelly as an ingredient; the 1758 edition gave the first mention of 'Hamburgh sausages' and piccalilli, while the 1774 edition of the book included one of the first recipes in English for an Indian-style curry. Glasse criticised French influence of British cuisine, but included dishes with French names and French influence in the book. Other recipes use imported ingredients including cocoa, cinnamon, nutmeg, pistachios and musk. The book was popular in the Thirteen Colonies of America, and its appeal survived the American War of Independence -"

The lecturer halted, listening for a query from the class about Iranian Plateau or some other topic.

The professor carried on.

The instructor seethed happily, "-. Some European languages of this family, such as English, French, Portuguese, Russian, Dutch, and Spanish, have expanded through colonialism in the modern period and are now spoken across several continents. The Indo-European family is divided into several branches or sub-families, of which there are eight groups with languages still alive today: Albanian, Armenian, Balto-Slavic, Celtic, Germanic, Hellenic, Indo-Iranian, and Italic; and another six subdivisions which are now extinct. Today, the most populous individual languages are English, Hindustani, Spanish, Bengali, French, Russian, Portuguese, German, Persian and Punjabi, each with over 100 million native speakers. However, many other Indo-European languages are small and in danger of extinction: Cornish, for instance, has fewer than 600 speakers.In total, 46 percent of the world's population (3.2 billion) speaks an Indo-European language as a first language, by far the highest of any language family. There are about 445 living Indo-European languages, according to the estimate by Ethnologue -"

"What's Thirty Years' War?" a student asked confidently.

The lecturer paid no attention to the interruption and continued.

The lecturer breathed slowly, "- between Catholicism and Protestantism was a significant shaping process in the history of Central Europe, and neither side was able to prevail in the region as a whole. The concept of “Central Europe” appeared in the 19th century. First, it was understood as a contact zone between the two main European regions of modern times – the Southern (Mediterranean and Catholic) and the Northern (Baltic and Protestant) areas. However, under the influenced of great power rivalry since the late 19th century, the term was redefined along the geopolitical divisions of Europe. As historians Piahanau and Aleksov point out, “The terms “Middle” or “Central” Europe (German Mitteleuropa, French Europe centrale) appeared nearly simultaneously in German and French geographic scholarship in the early nineteenth century. Initially, both traditions associated the terms with the territories from the Pyrenees -"

The schoolteacher said robotically, "- covers approximately 361,000,000 km2 (139,000,000 sq mi) of the planet. The ocean is the principal component of Earth's hydrosphere, and therefore integral to life on Earth. Acting as a huge heat reservoir, the ocean influences climate and weather patterns, the carbon cycle, and the water cycle. Oceanographers divide the ocean into different vertical and horizontal zones based on physical and biological conditions. The pelagic zone consists of the water column from surface to ocean floor throughout the open ocean. The water column is further categorized in other zones depending on depth and on how much light is present. The photic zone includes water from the surface to a depth of 200 m, where photosynthesis can occur. This makes the photic zone the most biodiverse. Photosynthesis -"

"What's Photosynthesis?" a student interjected sullenly.

The teacher ignored the interruption and carried on.

The lecturer breathed timidly, "- by plants and microscopic algae (free floating phytoplankton) creates organic matter from chemical precursors like water and carbon dioxide. This upper sunlit zone is the origin of the food supply which sustains most of the ocean ecosystem. Light only penetrates to a depth of a few hundred meters; the remaining ocean below is cold and dark. The continental shelf where the ocean approaches dry land is more shallow, with a depth of a few hundred meters or less. Human activity has a greater impact on the continental shelf. Ocean temperatures depend on the amount of solar radiation reaching the ocean surface. In the tropics, surface temperatures can rise to over 30 °C (86 °F). Near the poles where sea ice forms, the temperature in equilibrium is about −2 °C (28 °F). Deep sea -"

"What's Water?" a student questioned excitedly.

The professor acknowledged the question with a smirk.

The professor paid no heed to the interruption and carried on.

The educator explained robotically, "- continuously circulates in the oceans creating ocean currents. These directed movements of seawater are generated by forces acting upon the water, including temperature differences, atmospheric circulation (wind), the Coriolis effect -"

The schoolteacher continued.

The teacher muttered pointedly, "-, rather than by the government of the state in which it is located. The 326 Indian reservations in the United States are associated with specific Native American nations, often on a one-to-one basis. Some of the country's 574 federally recognized tribes govern more than one reservation, while some share reservations, and others have no reservation at all. In addition, because of past land allotments, leading to sales to non–Native Americans, some reservations are severely fragmented, with each piece of tribal, individual, and privately held land being a separate enclave. This jumble of private and public real estate creates significant administrative, political and legal difficulties.The collective geographical area of all reservations is 56,200,000 acres (22,700,000 ha; 87,800 sq mi; 227,000 km2), approximately the size of the state of Idaho -"

The ocean is the principal component of Earth's hydrosphere, and therefore integral to life on Earth. Acting as a huge heat reservoir, the ocean influences climate and weather patterns, the carbon cycle, and the water cycle. Oceanographers divide the ocean into different vertical and horizontal zones based on physical and biological conditions. The pelagic zone consists of the water column from surface to ocean floor throughout the open ocean. The water column is further categorized in other zones depending on depth and on how much light is present. The photic zone includes water from the surface to a depth of 200 m, where photosynthesis can occur. This makes the photic zone the most biodiverse. Photosynthesis by plants and microscopic algae (free floating phytoplankton) creates organic matter from chemical precursors like water and carbon dioxide. This upper sunlit zone is the origin of the food supply which sustains most of the ocean ecosystem. Light only penetrates to a depth of a few hundred meters; the remaining ocean below is cold and dark. The continental shelf where the ocean approaches dry land is more shallow, with a depth of a few hundred meters or less. Human activity has a greater impact on the continental shelf. Ocean temperatures depend on the amount of solar radiation reaching the ocean surface. In the tropics, surface temperatures can rise to over 30 °C (86 °F). Near the poles where sea ice forms, the temperature in equilibrium is about −2 °C (28 °F). Deep sea -"

The surrounding water is usually understood to be continuous, though not necessarily named as a body of water. A river which courses through a very tight meander is also sometimes said to form a 'peninsula' within the (almost closed) loop of water. A peninsula is land with bodies of water on three sides of it. There is no precise definition distinguishing peninsulas from less prominent extensions, and extensions conventionally considered peninsulas are not always named as such; they can also be referred to as a headland, cape, island promontory, bill, point, fork, or spit. A point is generally considered a piece of land projecting into a body of water that is less prominent than a cape. The area of peninsulas can range from tiny to very large. In English, the plural forms of peninsula are peninsulas or “sular” A form of the peninsula is the headland and the particularly narrow spit that has been washed up . If a peninsula is located in an inland body of water (lake, river) it is also referred to as an 'inland peninsula'. Barrier peninsula List of peninsulas -"

# Lesson 13: Oncidium gardneri

"Good morning, class! Today we'll be talking about Oncidium gardneri," the instructor said slowly.

The students listened in rapt attention.

The schoolteacher sang sadly, "Oncidium -"

The teacher took a breath, anticipating a question from the students about Oncidium or some other topic.

The teacher continued.

The teacher seethed calmly, "- gardneri is a species of orchid native to southern and southeastern Brazil -"

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The educator announced excitedly, "Brazil (Portuguese: Brasil; Brazilian Portuguese -"

"What's Brazilian Portuguese?" a boy blurted timidly.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The educator sang calmly, "Brazilian Portuguese (português do Brasil, [poɾtʊˈɡez dʊ bɾaˈziw] or português brasileiro [poɾtʊˈɡez bɾaziˈlejɾʊ]) or also português sul americano is the set of dialects of the Portuguese language native to Brazil and the most influential form of Portuguese worldwide. It is spoken by almost all of the 200 million inhabitants of Brazil and spoken widely across the Brazilian diaspora -"

"What's Brazilian diaspora?" a boy piped up timidly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the query with a smile.

The instructor muttered mechanically, "The Brazil -"

The educator took a breath, anticipating a query from the students about Brazil or some other topic.

The class sat straighter in their seats.

The educator continued.

The professor murmured gently, "-ian diaspora refers to the migration of Brazilians to other countries, a mostly recent phenomenon that has been driven mainly by economic problems that afflicted Brazil in the 1980s and 1990s. There are an estimated 3.1 million Brazilians living abroad, mainly in the U.S. (1,410,000), Japan -"

"What's Japan?" a student quizzed politely.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The professor sang slowly, "Japan (Japanese: 日本, Nippon or Nihon, and formally 日本国) is an island country in East Asia -"

The students sat straighter in their seats.

The schoolteacher carried on.

The lecturer said sullenly, "- is the largest and deepest of Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean -"

The instructor halted, expecting a query from the students about Arctic Ocean or some other topic.

The instructor carried on.

The lecturer muttered excitedly, "- in the north to the Southern Ocean -"

The teacher paused, expecting a question from the pupils about Southern Ocean or some other topic.

The educator noted confidently, "- and Australia -"

The teacher paused, anticipating a query from the class about Australia or some other topic.

The teacher proceeded.

The professor seethed quickly, "- in the west and the Americas -"

The instructor paused, listening for a question from the pupils about Americas or some other topic.

The teacher proceeded.

The educator said crudely, "- in the east. At 165,250,000 square kilometers (63,800,000 square miles) in the area (as defined with a southern Antarctic border), this largest division of the World Ocean -"

The educator halted, expecting a question from the pupils about World Ocean or some other topic.

The teacher proceeded.

The instructor breathed gently, "-—and, in turn, the hydrosphere—covers about 46% of Earth's water surface and about 32% of its total surface area, larger than all of Earth's land area combined (148,000,000 square kilometers).

"What's Western Hemisphere?" a boy wondered pointedly.

The schoolteacher paid no heed to the interruption and proceeded.

The lecturer elaborated quietly, "- are in the Pacific Ocean. Ocean circulation (caused by the Coriolis effect -"

"What's Coriolis effect?" a student said carefully.

The instructor paid no heed to the interruption and carried on.

The instructor noted aggressively, "-) subdivides it into two largely independent volumes of water, which meet at the equator: the North(ern) Pacific Ocean and South(ern) Pacific Ocean. The Galápagos and Gilbert Islands -"

"What's Gilbert Islands?" a pupil raised sadly.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a nod.

The lecturer elaborated robotically, "The Gilbert Islands (Gilbertese: Tungaru; formerly Kingsmill or King's-Mill Islands) are a chain of sixteen atolls and coral islands in the Pacific Ocean -"

"What's Pacific Ocean?" a pupil wondered carefully.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a grin.

The lecturer declared, "The Pacific -"

"What's Pacific?" a girl said pointedly.

The educator acknowledged the query with a nod.

The schoolteacher announced carefully, "The Pacific Ocean -"

"What's Ocean?" a pupil raised slowly.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The professor murmured aggressively, "The ocean (also the sea or the world ocean) is the body of salt water which covers approximately 70.8% of the surface of Earth -"

The educator paused, expecting a question from the students about Earth or some other topic.

The pupils listened in rapt attention.

The teacher carried on.

The lecturer declared happily, "- and contains 97% of Earth's water. Another definition is 'any of the large bodies of water into which the great ocean is divided'. Separate names are used to identify five different areas of the ocean: Pacific (the largest) Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic -"

"What's Arctic?" a boy said excitedly.

The schoolteacher disregarded the interruption and continued.

The instructor noted mechanically, "- (the smallest). Sea -"

"What's Sea?" a student blurted sullenly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a smile.

The schoolteacher paid no heed to the interruption and proceeded.

The educator murmured aggressively, "-water -"

"What's Seawater?" a pupil quizzed mechanically.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The professor breathed confidently, "Sea -"

The teacher paused, anticipating a question from the pupils about Sea or some other topic.

The instructor proceeded.

The educator explained confidently, "-water, or salt water, is water from a sea or ocean. On average, seawater in the world's oceans has a salinity of about 3.5% (35 g/l, 35 ppt, 600 mM). This means that every kilogram (roughly one liter by volume) of seawater has approximately 35 grams (1.2 oz) of dissolved salts (predominantly sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl−) ions). Average density at the surface is 1.025 kg/l. Seawater is denser than both fresh water and pure water (density 1.0 kg/l at 4 °C (39 °F)) because the dissolved salts increase the mass by a larger proportion than the volume. In comparison, most human physiological saline levels are approximately one quarter of this, for example blood is 9g/l (0.9% w/v). The freezing point of seawater decreases as salt concentration increases. At typical salinity, it freezes at about −2 °C (28 °F). The coldest seawater still in the liquid state ever recorded was found in 2010, in a stream under an Antarctic -"

The lecturer took a breath, expecting a question from the pupils about Antarctic or some other topic.

The students sniggered.

The lecturer carried on.

The instructor explained mechanically, "- glacier: the measured temperature was −2.6 °C (27.3 °F). Seawater pH is typically limited to a range between 7.5 and 8.4. However, there is no universally accepted reference pH-scale for seawater and the difference between measurements based on different reference scales may be up to 0.14 units. Although the vast majority of seawater has a salinity of between 31 g/kg and 38 g/kg, that is 3.1–3.8%, seawater is not uniformly saline throughout the world. Where mixing occurs with freshwater runoff from river mouths, near melting glaciers or vast amounts of precipitation (e.g. Monsoon), seawater can be substantially less saline. The most saline open sea is the Red Sea, where high rates of evaporation, low precipitation and low river run-off, and confined circulation result in unusually salty water. The salinity in isolated bodies of water can be considerably greater still - about ten times higher in the case of the Dead Sea. Historically, several salinity scales were used to approximate the absolute salinity of seawater. A popular scale was the 'Practical Salinity -"

"What's Salinity?" a pupil said furiously.

The professor ignored the interruption and carried on.

The professor murmured crudely, "- Scale -"

"What's Practical Salinity Scale?" a boy said gently.

The educator acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The professor noted crudely, "Salinity () is the saltiness or amount of salt dissolved in a body of water, called saline water (see also soil salinity). It is usually measured in g/L or g/kg (grams of salt per liter/kilogram of water; the latter is dimensionless and equal to ‰). Salinity is an important factor in determining many aspects of the chemistry of natural waters and of biological processes within it, and is a thermodynamic state variable that, along with temperature and pressure, governs physical characteristics like the density and heat capacity of the water. A contour line of constant salinity is called an isohaline, or sometimes isohale. Salinity in rivers, lakes, and the ocean is conceptually simple, but technically challenging to define and measure precisely. Conceptually the salinity is the quantity of dissolved salt content of the water. Salts are compounds like sodium chloride, magnesium sulfate, potassium nitrate, and sodium bicarbonate which dissolve into ions. The concentration of dissolved chloride ions is sometimes referred to as chlorinity. Operationally, dissolved matter is defined as that which can pass through a very fine filter (historically a filter with a pore size of 0.45 μm, but nowadays usually 0.2 μm). Salinity can be expressed in the form of a mass fraction, i.e. the mass of the dissolved material in a unit mass of solution. Seawater typically has a mass salinity of around 35 g/kg, although lower values are typical near coasts where rivers enter the ocean. Rivers and lakes can have a wide range of salinities, from less than 0.01 g/kg to a few g/kg, although there are many places where higher salinities are found. The Dead Sea -"

The schoolteacher paused, listening for a query from the class about Dead Sea or some other topic.

The students sniggered.

The instructor proceeded.

The professor murmured carefully, "- has a salinity of more than 200 g/kg. Rainwater before touching the ground typically has a TDS of 20 mg/L or less.Whatever pore size is used in the definition, the resulting salinity value of a given sample of natural water will not vary by more than a few percent (%). Physical oceanographers working in the abyssal ocean, however, are often concerned with precision and intercomparability of measurements by different researchers, at different times, to almost five significant digits. A bottled seawater product known as IAPSO Standard Seawater is used by oceanographers to standardize their measurements with enough precision to meet this requirement. Measurement and definition difficulties arise because natural waters contain a complex mixture of many different elements from different sources (not all from dissolved salts) in different molecular forms. The chemical properties of some of these forms depend on temperature and pressure. Many of these forms are difficult to measure with high accuracy, and in any case complete chemical analysis is not practical when analyzing multiple samples. Different practical definitions of salinity result from different attempts to account for these problems, to different levels of precision, while still remaining reasonably easy to use. For practical reasons salinity is usually related to the sum of masses of a subset of these dissolved chemical constituents (so-called solution salinity), rather than to the unknown mass of salts that gave rise to this composition (an exception is when artificial seawater is created). For many purposes this sum can be limited to a set of eight major ions in natural waters, although for seawater at highest precision an additional seven minor ions are also included. The major ions dominate the inorganic composition of most (but by no means all) natural waters. Exceptions include some pit lakes and waters from some hydrothermal springs. The concentrations of dissolved gases like oxygen and nitrogen are not usually included in descriptions of salinity. However, carbon dioxide gas, which when dissolved is partially converted into carbonates and bicarbonates, is often included. Silicon -"

The educator looked around, anticipating a question from the students about Silicon or some other topic.

The pupils sat straighter in their seats.

The teacher carried on.

"Well then, turning back our attention to Seawater....", the professor sang confidently.

The class sat straighter in their seats.

"Alright, turning back our attention to Ocean....", the professor noted furiously.

The pupils suppressed giggles.

# Lesson 14: Tisentnops

"Hello, class! Today we'll be discussing Tisentnops," the instructor declared gently.

The students sniggered.

The professor explained slowly, "Tisentnops is a genus of South America -"

The educator halted, listening for a query from the students about South America or some other topic.

The students sniggered.

The teacher proceeded.

The educator explained crudely, "-n araneomorph spiders in the family Caponiidae -"

"What's Caponiidae?" a student said robotically.

The lecturer disregarded the interruption and proceeded.

The educator noted timidly, "-, first described by Norman I. Platnick -"

"What's Norman I. Platnick?" a boy interjected sullenly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a grin.

The lecturer murmured slowly, "Norman Ira Platnick (December 30, 1951 – April 8, 2020) was an American biological systematist and arachnologist. At the time of his death, he was a Professor -"

"What's Professor?" a boy raised mechanically.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a smile.

The lecturer paid no attention to the interruption and continued.

The lecturer breathed sullenly, "- Emeritus -"

"What's Emeritus?" a boy raised politely.

The instructor acknowledged the query with a grin.

The instructor breathed timidly, "Emeritus (; female: Emerita), in its current usage, is an adjective used to designate a retired chair, professor, pastor, bishop, pope, director, president, prime minister, rabbi, emperor, or other person who has been 'permitted to retain as an honorary title the rank of the last office held'.In some cases, the term is conferred automatically upon all persons who retire at a given rank, but in others, it remains a mark of distinguished service, awarded only to a few on retirement. It is also used when a person of distinction in a profession retires or hands over the position, enabling their former rank to be retained in their title, e.g., 'professor emeritus'. The term emeritus does not necessarily signify that a person has relinquished all the duties of their former position, and they may continue to exercise some of them. The title emeritus is not used for a deceased person, except in obituaries, where it may indicate their status at the time of death. Emeritus (past participle of Latin -"

The instructor looked around, anticipating a query from the students about Latin or some other topic.

The schoolteacher continued.

The instructor elaborated excitedly, "- emerere, meaning 'complete one's service') is a compound of the Latin prefix e- (variant of ex-) meaning 'out of, from' and merere (source of 'merit') meaning 'to serve, earn'. The word is attested since the early 17th century with the meaning 'having served out one's time, having done sufficient service.' The Latin feminine equivalent, emerita (), is also sometimes used, however, in English the word emeritus is often unmarked for gender. In the United States and other countries, a tenured full professor who retires from an educational institution in good standing may be given the title 'professor emeritus'. The title 'professor emerita' is sometimes used for women. In most systems and institutions, the rank is bestowed on all professors who have retired in good standing, while at others, it needs a special act or vote. Professors emeriti may, depending on local circumstances, retain office space or other privileges. The adjective may be placed before or after the title, e.g., 'professor emeritus' or 'emeritus professor'. Emeritus is sometimes applied to tenured associate professors or non-tenure-track faculty. In the United Kingdom and most other parts of the world, the term 'emeritus professor' is given only to a person of outstanding merit who had full professorial status before he or she retired. The possession of a PhD or other higher degree, or even full professorial status, is not sufficient for calling oneself 'emeritus professor' upon retirement. The term 'Professor Emeritus' is also recognised in the United Kingdom. The word is capitalized when it forms part of a title which is capitalized. When a diocesan bishop or auxiliary bishop retires, the word emeritus is added to his former title, i.e., 'Archbishop Emeritus of ...'. The term 'Bishop Emeritus' of a particular see can apply to several people, if the first lives long enough. The title was applied to the Bishop of Rome, Pope Emeritus -"

The schoolteacher took a breath, expecting a query from the class about Pope Emeritus or some other topic.

The educator carried on.

The professor explained happily, "- Benedict XVI -"

The professor halted, anticipating a query from the class about Benedict XVI or some other topic.

The pupils suppressed giggles.

The schoolteacher continued.

The teacher explained gently, "-, on his retirement. In Community of Christ, the status of emeritus is occasionally granted to senior officials upon retirement. In Judaism -"

"What's Judaism?" a pupil piped up breathlessly.

The instructor acknowledged the query with a smile.

The instructor paid no heed to the interruption and proceeded.

The professor said carefully, "-, emeritus is often a title granted to long-serving rabbis of synagogues or other Jewish institutions. In some cases, the title is also granted to chazzans. Rabbi -"

"What's Rabbi?" a student piped up confidently.

The schoolteacher disregarded the interruption and carried on.

The lecturer noted happily, "- Emeritus or Cantor Emeritus is largely an honorific title. Since 2001, the honorary title of president pro tempore emeritus has been given to a senator of the minority party who has previously served as president pro tempore of the United States Senate. The position has been held by Strom Thurmond (R-South Carolina) (2001–2003), Robert Byrd -"

"What's Robert Byrd?" a girl wondered timidly.

The instructor acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The schoolteacher muttered gently, "Robert Carlyle Byrd (born Cornelius Calvin Sale Jr.; November 20, 1917 – June 28, 2010) was an American lawyer and politician who served as a United States Senator -"

The schoolteacher said happily, "The United States -"

The instructor paused, waiting for a query from the students about United States or some other topic.

The class suppressed giggles.

The schoolteacher continued.

The educator sang slowly, "- Senate is the upper chamber of the United States Congress -"

"What's United States Congress?" a student queried aggressively.

The schoolteacher disregarded the interruption and proceeded.

The educator breathed carefully, "-, with the House of Representatives being the lower chamber. Together they compose the national bicameral legislature of the United States. The composition and powers of the Senate are established by Article One of the United States Constitution -"

"What's Article One of the United States Constitution?" a pupil blurted slowly.

The professor disregarded the interruption and carried on.

The professor elaborated breathlessly, "-. The Senate is composed of senators, each of whom represents a single state in its entirety. Each state is equally represented by two senators who serve staggered terms of six years. There are currently 100 senators representing the 50 states. The vice president of the United States serves as presiding officer and president of the Senate by virtue of that office, and has a vote only if the senators are equally divided. In the vice president's absence, the president pro tempore, who is traditionally the senior member of the party holding a majority of seats, presides over the Senate. As the upper chamber of Congress, the Senate has several powers of advice and consent which are unique to it. These include the approval of treaties, and the confirmation of Cabinet secretaries, Supreme Court justices, federal judges, flag officers, regulatory officials, ambassadors, other federal executive officials and federal uniformed officers. If no candidate receives a majority of electors for vice president, the duty falls to the Senate to elect one of the top two recipients of electors for that office. The Senate conducts trials of those impeached by the House. The Senate is widely considered both a more deliberative and more prestigious body than the House of Representatives due to its longer terms, smaller size, and statewide constituencies, which historically led to a more collegial and less partisan atmosphere.From 1789 to 1913, senators were appointed by legislatures of the states they represented. They are now elected by popular vote following the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913. In the early 1920s, the practice of majority and minority parties electing their floor leaders began. The Senate's legislative and executive business is managed and scheduled by the Senate majority leader. The Senate chamber is located in the north wing of the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. -"

"What's Washington, D.C.?" a boy queried confidently.

The schoolteacher disregarded the interruption and proceeded.

The educator declared quietly, "- The drafters of the Constitution created a bicameral Congress primarily as a compromise between those who felt that each state, since it was sovereign, should be equally represented, and those who felt the legislature must directly represent the people, as the House of Commons did in Great Britain. This idea of having one chamber represent people equally, while the other gives equal representation to states regardless of population, was known as the Connecticut Compromise. There was also a desire to have two Houses that could act as an internal check on each other. One was intended to be a 'People's House' directly elected by the people, and with short terms obliging the representatives to remain close to their constituents. The other was intended to represent the states to such extent as they retained their sovereignty except for the powers expressly delegated to the national government. The Constitution provides that the approval of both chambers is necessary for the passage of legislation.First convened in 1789, the Senate of the United States was formed on the example of the ancient Roman Senate -"

"What's Roman Senate?" a student asked gently.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The schoolteacher murmured robotically, "The Roman Senate (Latin: Senātus Rōmānus) was a governing and advisory assembly in ancient Rome -"

"What's Augustus?" a boy said calmly.

The lecturer disregarded the interruption and continued.

The schoolteacher announced timidly, "- to the military anarchy of the 3rd century, it was a principate with Italy as metropole of the provinces and the city of Rome as sole capital (27 BC – AD 286). After the military crisis, the empire was ruled by multiple emperors who shared rule over the Western Roman Empire -"

The professor halted, listening for a query from the students about Western Roman Empire or some other topic.

The instructor breathed furiously, "-, following the capture of Ravenna -"

"What's Ravenna?" a boy demanded carefully.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The schoolteacher announced furiously, "A raven is any of several larger-bodied species of the genus Corvus -"

"What's Corvus?" a girl raised gingerly.

The teacher ignored the interruption and carried on.

The teacher sang slowly, "-. These species do not form a single taxonomic group within the genus. There is no consistent distinction between 'crows' and 'ravens', and these appellations have been assigned to different species chiefly on the basis of their size. The largest raven species are the common raven and the thick-billed raven. The term 'raven' originally referred to the common raven (Corvus corax), the type species of the genus Corvus, which has a larger distribution than any other species of Corvus, ranging over much of the Northern Hemisphere. The modern English word raven has cognates in all other Germanic languages -"

"What's Germanic languages?" a pupil interjected gingerly.

The schoolteacher proceeded.

The schoolteacher seethed politely, "- (h)raban, all of which descend from Proto-Germanic -"

"What's Proto-Germanic?" a pupil queried timidly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a grin.

The teacher declared breathlessly, "Proto-Germanic (abbreviated PGmc; also called Common Germanic) is the reconstructed proto-language of the Germanic branch of the Indo-European languages. Proto-Germanic eventually developed from pre-Proto-Germanic into three Germanic branches during the fifth century BC to fifth century AD: West Germanic, East Germanic -"

The educator looked around, anticipating a query from the pupils about East Germanic or some other topic.

The lecturer carried on.

The lecturer muttered confidently, "- and North Germanic, which however remained in contact over a considerable time, especially the Ingvaeonic languages (including English), which arose from West Germanic dialects and remained in continued contact with North Germanic. A defining feature of Proto-Germanic is the completion of the process described by Grimm's law -"

The educator proceeded.

The teacher declared excitedly, "- and its gradual divergence into a separate language. As it is probable that the development of this sound shift spanned a considerable time (several centuries), Proto-Germanic cannot adequately be reconstructed as a simple node in a tree model but rather represents a phase of development that may span close to a thousand years. The end of the Common Germanic period is reached with the beginning of the Migration Period in the fourth century. The alternative term 'Germanic parent language' may be used to include a larger scope of linguistic developments, spanning the Nordic Bronze Age -"

"What's Nordic Bronze Age?" a student interjected mechanically.

The teacher said confidently, "Bronze is an alloy consisting primarily of copper, commonly with about 12–12.5% tin and often with the addition of other metals (such as aluminium, manganese, nickel or zinc) and sometimes non-metals or metalloids such as arsenic, phosphorus or silicon. These additions produce a range of alloys that may be harder than copper alone, or have other useful properties, such as strength, ductility, or machinability. The archaeological period in which bronze was the hardest metal in widespread use is known as the Bronze Age -"

"What's Bronze Age?" a boy blurted sadly.

The instructor paid no heed to the interruption and carried on.

The educator proceeded.

The lecturer elaborated sullenly, "- system, as proposed in modern times by Christian Jürgensen Thomsen, for classifying and studying ancient societies and history. An ancient civilization is deemed to be part of the Bronze Age because it either produced bronze by smelting its own copper and alloying it with tin, arsenic, or other metals, or traded other items for bronze from production areas elsewhere. Bronze was harder and more durable than other metals available at the time, allowing Bronze Age civilizations to gain a technological advantage. While terrestrial iron is naturally abundant, its high melting point of 1538 °C (2800 °F) placed it out of reach of common use until the end of the second millennium BC. Tin -"

The professor declared excitedly, "A federation (also known as a federal state) is a political entity characterized by a union of partially self-governing provinces, states, or other regions under a central federal government (federalism). In a federation, the self-governing status of the component states, as well as the division of power between them and the central government, is typically constitutionally entrenched and may not be altered by a unilateral decision of either party, the states or the federal political body. Alternatively, a federation is a form of government in which sovereign power is formally divided between a central authority and a number of constituent regions so that each region retains some degree of control over its internal affairs. It is often argued that federal states where the central government has overriding powers are not truly federal states. For example, such overriding powers may include: the constitutional authority to suspend a constituent state's government by invoking gross mismanagement or civil unrest, or to adopt national legislation that overrides or infringes on the constituent states' powers by invoking the central government's constitutional authority to ensure 'peace and good government' or to implement obligations contracted under an international treaty. The governmental or constitutional structure found in a federation is considered to be federalist, or to be an example of federalism. It can be considered the opposite of another system, the unitary state. France -"
