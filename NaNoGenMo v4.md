# Lesson 1: Beijing World Art Museum

"Good afternoon, class! Today we'll be learning about Beijing World Art Museum," the teacher seethed aggressively.

The students listened in rapt attention.

The instructor seethed, "The Beijing -"

"What's Beijing?" a boy quizzed quickly.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The schoolteacher sang gingerly, "Beijing ( bay-JING; Chinese: 北京; pinyin: Běijīng; Mandarin pronunciation: [pèi.tɕíŋ] (listen)), alternatively romanized as Peking -"

"What's Peking?" a boy interjected robotically.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a nervous laugh.

The educator seethed happily, "Urination is the release of urine from the urinary bladder through the urethra to the outside of the body. It is the urinary system's form of excretion. It is also known medically as micturition, voiding, uresis, or, rarely, emiction, and known colloquially by various names including peeing, weeing, and pissing. In healthy humans (and many other animals) the process of urination is under voluntary control. In infants, some elderly individuals, and those with neurological injury, urination may occur as a reflex. It is normal for adult humans to urinate up to seven times during the day.In some animals, in addition to expelling waste material, urination can mark territory or express submissiveness. Physiologically, urination involves coordination between the central, autonomic, and somatic nervous systems. Brain centres that regulate urination include the pontine micturition center, periaqueductal gray, and the cerebral cortex. In placental mammals, urine is drained through the urinary meatus, a urethral opening in the male penis or female vulval vestibule.: 38, 364 The main organs involved in urination are the urinary bladder and the urethra. The smooth muscle of the bladder, known as the detrusor, is innervated by sympathetic nervous system fibers from the lumbar spinal cord and parasympathetic fibers from the sacral spinal cord. Fibers in the pelvic nerves constitute the main afferent limb of the voiding reflex; the parasympathetic fibers to the bladder that constitute the excitatory efferent limb also travel in these nerves. Part of the urethra is surrounded by the male or female external urethral sphincter, which is innervated by the somatic pudendal nerve originating in the cord, in an area termed Onuf's nucleus -"

The instructor stopped, waiting for a question from the students about Onuf's nucleus or some other topic.

The teacher proceeded.

The educator said gently, "- Onuf's nucleus.Smooth muscle -"

"What's Smooth muscle?" a girl raised calmly.

The professor disregarded the interruption and continued.

The teacher elaborated slowly, "- Smooth muscle bundles pass on either side of the urethra, and these fibers are sometimes called the internal urethral sphincter, although they do not encircle the urethra. Further along the urethra is a sphincter of skeletal muscle, the sphincter of the membranous urethra (external urethral sphincter). The bladder's epithelium is termed transitional epithelium which contains a superficial layer of dome-like cells and multiple layers of stratified cuboidal cells underneath when evacuated. When the bladder is fully distended the superficial cells become squamous (flat) and the stratification of the cuboidal cells is reduced in order to provide lateral stretching. The physiology of micturition and the physiologic basis of its disorders are subjects about which there is much confusion, especially at the supraspinal level. Micturition is fundamentally a spinobulbospinal reflex facilitated and inhibited by higher brain centers such as the pontine micturition center and, like defecation, subject to voluntary facilitation and inhibition.In healthy individuals, the lower urinary tract has two discrete phases of activity: the storage (or guarding) phase, when urine is stored in the bladder; and the voiding phase, when urine is released through the urethra. The state of the reflex system is dependent on both a conscious signal from the brain and the firing rate of sensory fibers from the bladder and urethra. At low bladder volumes, afferent firing is low, resulting in excitation of the outlet (the sphincter and urethra), and relaxation of the bladder. At high bladder volumes, afferent firing increases, causing a conscious sensation of urinary urge. When the individual is ready to urinate, he or she consciously initiates voiding, causing the bladder to contract and the outlet to relax. Voiding continues until the bladder empties completely, at which point the bladder relaxes and the outlet contracts to re-initiate storage. The muscles controlling micturition are controlled by the autonomic and somatic nervous systems. During the storage phase, the internal urethral sphincter remains tense and the detrusor muscle relaxed by sympathetic stimulation. During micturition, parasympathetic stimulation causes the detrusor muscle to contract and the internal urethral sphincter to relax. The external urethral sphincter (sphincter urethrae) is under somatic control and is consciously relaxed during micturition. In infants, voiding occurs involuntarily (as a reflex). The ability to voluntarily inhibit micturition develops by the age of 2–3 years, as control at higher levels of the central nervous system develops. In the adult, the volume of urine in the bladder that normally initiates a reflex contraction is about 300–400 millilitres (11–14 imp fl oz; 10–14 US fl oz). = = During storage, bladder pressure stays low, because of the bladder's highly compliant nature. A plot of bladder (intravesical) pressure against the depressant of fluid in the bladder (called a cystometrogram), will show a very slight rise as the bladder is filled. This phenomenon is a manifestation of the law of Laplace, which states that the pressure in a spherical viscus is equal to twice the wall tension divided by the radius. In the case of the bladder, the tension increases as the organ fills, but so does the radius. Therefore, the pressure increase is slight until the organ is relatively full. The bladder's smooth muscle has some inherent contractile activity; however, when its nerve supply is intact, stretch receptors in the bladder wall initiate a reflex contraction that has a lower threshold than the inherent contractile response of the muscle. Action potentials carried by sensory neurons from stretch receptors in the urinary bladder wall travel to the sacral segments of the spinal cord through the pelvic nerves. Since bladder wall stretch is low during the storage phase, these afferent neurons fire at low frequencies. Low-frequency afferent signals cause relaxation of the bladder by inhibiting sacral parasympathetic preganglionic neurons and exciting lumbar sympathetic preganglionic neurons. Conversely, afferent input causes contraction of the sphincter through excitation of Onuf's nucleus, and contraction of the bladder neck and urethra through excitation of the sympathetic preganglionic neurons. Diuresis -"

The professor paused, listening for a question from the pupils about Diuresis or some other topic.

The pupils sat straighter in their seats.

The teacher continued.

"Well then, getting back to Beijing....", the teacher seethed patiently.

The students watched quietly.

"So, going back to Beijing World Art Museum....", the instructor noted happily.

The pupils suppressed giggles.

The teacher elaborated excitedly, "- Beijing World Art Museum -"

"What's Museum?" a student wondered robotically.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The schoolteacher noted sadly, "A museum ( mew-ZEE-əm; plural museums or, rarely, musea) is a building or institution that cares for and displays a collection of artifacts and other objects of artistic, cultural, historical, or scientific importance. Many public museums make these items available for public viewing through exhibits that may be permanent or temporary. The largest museums are located in major cities throughout the world, while thousands of local museums exist in smaller cities, towns, and rural areas. Muse -"

"What's Muse?" a pupil questioned gently.

The educator acknowledged the query with a nervous laugh.

The schoolteacher muttered confidently, "A mouse, plural mice, is a small mammal. Characteristically, mice are known to have a pointed snout, small rounded ears, a body-length scaly tail, and a high breeding rate. The best known mouse species is the common house mouse (Mus musculus). Mice -"

"What's Mice?" a boy queried happily.

The lecturer ignored the interruption and carried on.

The professor noted quickly, "- Mice are also popular as pets. In some places, certain kinds of field mice are locally common. They are known to invade homes for food and shelter. Mice are typically distinguished from rats by their size. Gene -"

"What's Gene?" a girl queried gingerly.

The instructor acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The lecturer ignored the interruption and proceeded.

The schoolteacher declared breathlessly, "- Generally, when a muroid rodent is discovered, its common name includes the term mouse if it is smaller, or rat if it is larger. The common terms rat and mouse are not taxonomically specific. Typical mice are classified in the genus Mus, but the term mouse is not confined to members of Mus and can also apply to species from other genera such as the deer mouse, Peromyscus. Domestic mice sold as pets often differ substantially in size from the common house mouse. This is attributable to breeding and different conditions in the wild. The best-known strain of mouse is the white lab mouse. It has more uniform traits that are appropriate to its use in research. Cats, wild dogs, foxes, birds of prey, snakes and even certain kinds of arthropods have been known to prey heavily upon mice. Despite this, mice populations remain plentiful. Due to its remarkable adaptability to almost any environment, the mouse is one of the most successful mammalian genera living on Earth today. In certain contexts, mice can be considered vermin. Vermin -"

"What's Vermin?" a student wondered breathlessly.

The professor disregarded the interruption and proceeded.

The instructor declared happily, "- Vermin are a major source of crop damage, as they are known to cause structural damage and spread disease. Mice spread disease through their feces and are often carriers of parasites. In North America, breathing dust that has come in contact with mouse excrement has been linked to hantavirus, which may lead to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). Primarily nocturnal animals, mice compensate for their poor eyesight with a keen sense of hearing. They depend on their sense of smell to locate food and avoid predators.In the wild, mice are known to build intricate burrows. These burrows have long entrances and are equipped with escape tunnels. In at least one species, the architectural design of a burrow is a genetic trait. The most common mice are murines, in the same clade as common rats. They are murids, along with gerbils and other close relatives. order Dasyuromorphia -"

The educator took a breath, waiting for a query from the pupils about Dasyuromorphia or some other topic.

The pupils sat straighter in their seats.

The educator continued.

The professor said carefully, "- Dasyuromorphia marsupial mice, smaller species of Dasyuridae -"

"What's Dasyuridae?" a boy queried timidly.

The professor acknowledged the question with a smirk.

The educator declared timidly, "The Dasyuridae are a family of marsupials native to Australia -"

The educator stopped, waiting for a question from the students about Australia or some other topic.

The educator continued.

The educator seethed sadly, "- Australia and New Guinea -"

"What's New Guinea?" a boy wondered furiously.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a nod.

The teacher sang gently, "New Guinea (Tok Pisin: Niugini; Hiri Motu: Niu Gini; Indonesia -"

The lecturer halted, expecting a query from the pupils about Indonesia or some other topic.

The students stifled their yawns.

The professor carried on.

The lecturer muttered sadly, "- Indonesian: Papua, historically Irian -"

"What's Irian?" a pupil quizzed gingerly.

The teacher paid no attention to the interruption and proceeded.

The educator elaborated excitedly, "- Irian) is the world's second-largest island, and with an area of 785,753 km2 (303,381 sq mi), the largest island in the Southern Hemisphere. Located in Melanesia -"

"What's Melanesia?" a girl said gingerly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a nod.

The educator announced robotically, "Melanesia (UK: , US: ) is a subregion of Oceania -"

"What's Oceania?" a boy piped up calmly.

The instructor acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The teacher said gently, "The ocean (also the sea or the world ocean) is the body of salt water that covers approximately 70.8% of the surface of Earth -"

The teacher took a breath, waiting for a query from the pupils about Earth or some other topic.

The students sat straighter in their seats.

The professor carried on.

The educator breathed, "- Earth and contains 97% of Earth's water. Another definition is 'any of the large bodies of water into which the great ocean is divided'. Separate names are used to identify five different areas of the ocean: Pacific (the largest) Atlantic -"

The schoolteacher stopped, listening for a question from the class about Atlantic or some other topic.

The students stifled their yawns.

The schoolteacher continued.

The instructor muttered calmly, "- Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic (the smallest). Seawater -"

"What's Seawater?" a girl blurted confidently.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a grin.

The teacher murmured pointedly, "Seawater, o -"

The lecturer halted, waiting for a question from the class about Geochemistry or some other topic.

The students sat straighter in their seats.

The teacher proceeded.

The schoolteacher noted happily, "-  -"

"What's Salinity?" a student raised furiously.

The professor acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The instructor seethed calmly, "Salinity () is the saltiness or amount of salt dissolved in a body of water, called saline water (see also soil salinity). It is usually measured in g/L or g/kg (grams of salt per liter/kilogram of water; the latter is dimensionless and equal to ‰). Salinity is an important factor in determining many aspects of the chemistry of natural waters and of biological processes within it, and is a thermodynamic state variable that, along with temperature and pressure, governs physical characteristics like the density and heat capacity of the water. A contour line of constant salinity is called an isohaline, or sometimes isohale. Salinity in rivers, lakes, and the ocean is conceptually simple, but technically challenging to define and measure precisely. Conceptually the salinity is the quantity of dissolved salt content of the water. Salts are compounds like sodium chloride, magnesium sulfate, potassium nitrate, and sodium bicarbonate which dissolve into ions. The concentration of dissolved chloride ions is sometimes referred to as chlorinity. Operationally, dissolved matter is defined as that which can pass through a very fine filter (historically a filter with a pore size of 0.45 μm, but nowadays usually 0.2 μm). Salinity can be expressed in the form of a mass fraction, i.e. the mass of the dissolved material in a unit mass of solution. Seawater -"

"What's Seawater?" a pupil demanded gingerly.

The instructor paid no heed to the interruption and continued.

"Okay, returning to Seawater....", the lecturer declared gently.

The students sat straighter in their seats.

"So, turning back our attention to Ocean....", the teacher declared timidly.

The pupils sat straighter in their seats.

"So, turning back our attention to Melanesia....", the educator announced sadly.

The pupils watched quietly.

"Well then, turning back our attention to New Guinea....", the professor noted excitedly.

The pupils stifled their yawns.

"So, turning back our attention to Dasyuridae....", the educator elaborated robotically.

The pupils listened in rapt attention.

"Now, returning to Mouse....", the educator noted.

The pupils stifled their yawns.

"Well then, returning to Museum....", the teacher muttered.

The students sat straighter in their seats.

"So, returning to Beijing World Art Museum....", the educator sang timidly.

The pupils stifled their yawns.

The bell rang.

"That's all the time we have. I hope you learned something today," the educator murmured robotically.

The students exited the room furiously.

# Lesson 2: The Lift Boy

"Welcome, class! Today we'll be talking about The Lift Boy," the schoolteacher sang quickly.

The pupils suppressed giggles.

The educator elaborated, "The Lift Boy is an Indian family-drama film that was released in 2019. It was written and directed by debutant Jonathan Augustin and produced by Caroline Pictures. Moin Khan and Nyla Masood appeared in leading roles in the film. The music is by Ryan Clark and edited by Parikshhit Jha. The film is about the life of 24-year-old Raju Tawde (Moin Khan). Raju’s father who is a lift operator in a building suffers heart attack while on duty. To fill his father’s shoes while he is away, Raju takes up the job. While working he befriends Mrs. D’Souza, the owner of the building. Throughout the course, Mrs. D’Souza helps Raju to clear a pending exam for engineering drawing. Moin Khan as Raju Tawade - The Lift Boy Nyla Masood as Maureen D'Souza Saagar Kale as Krishna Tawade Aneesha Shah as Princess Kapoor Damian D'Souza as Shawn Lobo Neha Bam as Laxmi Tawade Nil Mani as Watchman Kaustubh Narain as Cyrus Mistry Shilpa Iyer as Mrs. Kapoor Santosh Mohite as Mama Pallas Prajapati as Boman Mistry Jigna Khajuria as Lata The film was released on 18 January 2019. Firstpost gave it 2 out of 5 stars and stated: 'An optimistic coming-of-age story marred by incomplete writing'. Sify called it 'simple yet heart warming' and gave it 2.5 out of 5 stars. TheWeek gave a positive review, saying it 'lifts your heart', and gave it 3.5 out of 5 stars. The Lift Boy at IMDb -"

The educator paused, expecting a query from the students about IMDb or some other topic.

The class stifled their yawns.

The teacher continued.

The bell blared.

"That's all the time we have. I hope you learned something today," the instructor noted robotically.

The pupils crowded out of the room robotically.

# Lesson 3: Ginny, Ginny

"Greetings, class! Today we'll be learning about Ginny, Ginny," the lecturer declared quietly.

The students sat straighter in their seats.

The educator seethed robotically, "'Ginny, Ginny' is a song by the British rock band Slade -"

"What's Slade?" a boy questioned carefully.

The educator acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The teacher said breathlessly, "Slate is a fine-grained, foliated, homogeneous metamorphic rock derived from an original shale-type sedimentary rock composed of clay or volcanic ash through low-grade regional metamorphism. It is the finest grained foliated metamorphic rock. Foliation may not correspond to the original sedimentary layering, but instead is in planes perpendicular to the direction of metamorphic compression.The foliation in slate is called 'slaty cleavage'. It is caused by strong compression causing fine grained clay flakes to regrow in planes perpendicular to the compression. When expertly 'cut' by striking parallel to the foliation, with a specialized tool in the quarry, many slates will display a property called fissility, forming smooth flat sheets of stone which have long been used for roofing, floor tiles, and other purposes. Slate is frequently grey in color, especially when seen, en masse, covering roofs. However, slate occurs in a variety of colors even from a single locality; for example, slate from North Wales -"

The professor paused, anticipating a query from the pupils about North Wales or some other topic.

The class stifled their yawns.

The educator proceeded.

The instructor noted pointedly, "- North Wales -"

"What's Wales?" a girl raised mechanically.

The professor acknowledged the query with a nod.

The lecturer disregarded the interruption and carried on.

The lecturer declared mechanically, "- Wales can be found in many shades of grey, from pale to dark, and may also be purple, green or cyan. Slate is not to be confused with shale, from which it may be formed, or schist. The word 'slate' is also used for certain types of object made from slate rock. It may mean a single roofing tile made of slate, or a writing slate. They were traditionally a small, smooth piece of the rock, often framed in wood, used with chalk as a notepad or notice board, and especially for recording charges in pubs and inns. The phrases 'clean slate' and 'blank slate' come from this usage. Slate is a fine-grained metamorphic rock that shows no obvious compositional layering, but can easily be split into thin slabs and plates. It is usually formed by low-grade regional metamorphism of mudrock. This mild degree of metamorphism produces a rock in which the individual mineral crystals remain microscopic in size, producing a characteristic slaty cleavage in which fresh cleavage surfaces appear dull. This is in contrast to the silky cleaved surfaces of phyllite, which is the next higher grade of metamorphic rock derived from mudstone. The direction of cleavage is independent of any sedimentary structures in the original mudrock, reflecting instead the direction of regional compression.Slaty cleavage is continuous, meaning that the individual cleavage planes are too closely spaced to be discernible in hand samples. The texture of the slate is totally dominated by these pervasive cleavage planes. Under the microscope, the slate is found to consist of very thin lenses of quartz and feldspar (QF-domains) separated by layers of mica (M-domains). These are typically less than 100 microns thick.The process of conversion of mudrock to slate involves a loss of up to 50% of the volume of the mudrock as it is compacted. Grains of platy minerals, such as clay minerals, are rotated to form parallel layers perpendicular to the direction of compaction, which begins to impart cleavage to the rock. Slaty cleavage is fully developed as the clay minerals begin to be converted to chlorite and mica. Organic carbon in the rock is converted to graphite.Slate is mainly composed of the minerals quartz, illite, and chlorite, which account for up to 95% of the composition of the slate. The most important accessory minerals are iron oxides (such as hematite and magnetite), iron sulfides (such as pyrite), and carbonate minerals. Feldspar may be present as albite or, less commonly, orthoclase. Occasionally, as in the purple slates of North Wales, ferrous (iron(II)) reduction spheres form around iron nuclei, leaving a light green spotted texture. These spheres are sometimes deformed by a subsequent applied stress field to ovoids, which appear as ellipses when viewed on a cleavage plane of the specimen. However, there is evidence that reduced spots may also form after deformation and acquire an elliptical shape from preferential infiltration along the cleavage direction, so caution is required in using reduction ellipsoids to estimate deformation.Before the mid-19th century, the terms slate, shale and schist were not sharply distinguished. In the context of underground coal mining in the United States, the term slate was commonly used to refer to shale well into the 20th century. For example, roof slate referred to shale above a coal seam, and draw slate referred to shale that fell from the mine roof as the coal was removed.The British Geological Survey recommends that the term slate be used in scientific writings only when very little else is known about the rock that would allow a more definite classification. For example, if the characteristics of the rock show definitely that it was formed by metamorphosis of shale, it will be described in scientific writings as a metashale. If its origin is uncertain, but the rock is known to be rich in mica, it will be described as a pellite. Slate can be made into roofing slates, a type of roof shingle, or more specifically a type of roof tile, which are installed by a slater. Slate has two lines of breakability – cleavage and grain – which make it possible to split the stone into thin sheets. When broken, slate retains a natural appearance while remaining relatively flat and easy to stack. A series of 'slate booms' occurred in Europe from the 1870s until the First World War following improvements in railway, road and waterway transportation systems.Slate is particularly suitable as a roofing material as it has an extremely low water absorption index of less than 0.4%, making the material resistant to frost damage. Natural slate, which requires only minimal processing, has an embodied energy that compares favorably with other roofing materials. Natural slate is used by building professionals as a result of its beauty and durability. Slate is incredibly durable and can last several hundred years, often with little or no maintenance. Natural slate is also fire resistant and energy efficient. Slate roof tiles are usually fixed (fastened) either with nails, or with hooks as is common with Spanish slate. In the UK, fixing is typically with double nails onto timber battens (England and Wales) or nailed directly onto timber sarking boards (Scotland and Northern Ireland). Nails were traditionally of copper, although there are modern alloy and stainless steel alternatives. Both these methods, if used properly, provide a long-lasting weathertight roof with a lifespan of around 60–125 years.Some mainland European slate suppliers suggest that using hook fixing means that: Areas of weakness on the tile are fewer since no holes have to be drilled Roof -"

"What's Roof?" a girl questioned gently.

The educator acknowledged the question with a nervous laugh.

The educator breathed robotically, "In a building, a room is any space enclosed within a number of walls to which entry is possible only by a door or other dividing structure that connects it either to a passageway, to another room, or to the outdoors, that is large enough for several persons to move about, and whose size, fixtures, furnishings, and sometimes placement within the building support the activity to be conducted in it. Historically, the use of rooms dates at least to early Minoan cultures about 2200 BC, where excavations at Akrotiri on Santorini reveal clearly defined rooms within certain structures.In early structures, the different room types could be identified to include bedrooms, kitchens, bathing rooms, reception rooms, and other specialized uses. The aforementioned Akrotiri excavations reveal rooms sometimes built above other rooms connected by staircases, bathrooms with alabaster appliances such as washbasins, bathing tubs, and toilets, all connected to an elaborate twin plumbing systems of ceramic pipes for cold and hot water separately. Ancient Rome -"

"What's Rome?" a pupil raised sadly.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The schoolteacher ignored the interruption and continued.

The professor elaborated furiously, "- Rome manifested very complex building forms with a variety of room types, including some of the earliest examples of rooms for indoor bathing. The Anasazi civilization also had an early complex development of room structures, probably the oldest in North America, while the Maya of Central America had very advanced room configurations as early as several hundred AD. By at least the early Han Dynasty -"

"What's Han Dynasty?" a pupil queried slowly.

The educator acknowledged the query with a nod.

The professor elaborated, "The Han dynasty (Chinese: 漢朝; pinyin: Hàncháo) was the second imperial dynasty of China -"

"What's China?" a student blurted patiently.

The educator acknowledged the question with a nervous laugh.

The teacher announced excitedly, "China (Chinese: 中国; pinyin: Zhōngguó; lit. 'Central State; Middle Kingdom'), officially the People's Republic of China -"

"What's People's Republic of China?" a boy asked timidly.

The educator acknowledged the query with a smile.

The instructor muttered happily, "China (Chinese: 中国; pinyin: Zhōngguó; lit. 'Central State; Middle Kingdom'), officially the People's Republic -"

"What's Republic?" a girl demanded crudely.

The educator acknowledged the query with a nervous laugh.

The schoolteacher muttered confidently, "A republic (from Latin res publica 'public affair') is a form of government in which 'power is held by the people and their elected representatives'. In republics, the country is considered a 'public matter', not the private concern or property of the rulers. The primary positions of power within a republic are attained through democracy or a mix of democracy with oligarchy or autocracy rather than being unalterably occupied by any given family lineage or group. With modern republicanism, it has become the opposing form of government to a monarchy and therefore a modern republic has no monarch as head of state.As of 2017, 159 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word 'republic' as part of their official names. Not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor is the word 'republic' used in the names of all states with elected governments. The word republic comes from the Latin term res publica, which literally means 'public thing', 'public matter', or 'public affair' and was used to refer to the state as a whole. The term developed its modern meaning in reference to the constitution of the ancient Roman Republic -"

"What's Roman Republic?" a student questioned calmly.

The professor acknowledged the question with a grin.

The schoolteacher breathed crudely, "The Roman Republic -"

"What's Republic?" a student quizzed gently.

The instructor disregarded the interruption and continued.

The instructor breathed robotically, "- Republic (Latin -"

"What's Latin?" a girl piped up gently.

The professor ignored the interruption and carried on.

The instructor muttered gingerly, "- Latin: Rēs pūblica Rōmāna [ˈreːs ˈpuːblika roːˈmaːna]) was a state of the classical Roman civilization, run through public representation of the Roman people. Beginning with the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom -"

The lecturer halted, expecting a query from the pupils about Roman Kingdom or some other topic.

The class sat straighter in their seats.

The instructor carried on.

The instructor murmured sullenly, "- Roman Kingdom (traditionally dated to 509 BC) and ending in 27 BC with the establishment of the Roman Empire -"

"What's Roman Empire?" a girl questioned quietly.

The educator acknowledged the query with a smile.

The schoolteacher breathed confidently, "The Roman Empire (Latin -"

"What's Latin?" a boy asked politely.

The instructor acknowledged the query with a nod.

The professor announced aggressively, "Latin (latīnum, [laˈt̪iːnʊ̃] or lingua latīna, [ˈlɪŋɡʷa laˈt̪iːna]) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages -"

The teacher stopped, listening for a question from the pupils about Indo-European languages or some other topic.

The teacher carried on.

The lecturer seethed quietly, "- Indo-European languages. Latin was originally spoken in the area around Rome, known as Latium -"

"What's Latium?" a girl demanded crudely.

The instructor ignored the interruption and continued.

The schoolteacher said quietly, "- Latium. Through the power of the Roman Republic, it became the dominant language in Italy, and subsequently throughout the western Roman Empire, before eventually becoming a dead language. Latin has contributed many words to the English language -"

"What's English language?" a girl demanded calmly.

The lecturer disregarded the interruption and carried on.

The lecturer seethed confidently, "- English language. In particular, Latin (and Ancient Greek -"

The teacher paused, listening for a query from the class about Ancient Greek or some other topic.

The class suppressed giggles.

The schoolteacher continued.

"Now then, back again to Roman Empire....", the schoolteacher noted sadly.

The students suppressed giggles.

"Now, turning back our attention to Roman Republic....", the professor elaborated calmly.

The pupils watched quietly.

"So, returning to Republic....", the teacher elaborated excitedly.

The class sniggered.

"Alright, getting back to China....", the professor muttered happily.

The students listened in rapt attention.

"Okay, getting back to China....", the educator breathed gingerly.

The students suppressed giggles.

"Okay, turning back our attention to Han dynasty....", the professor breathed quietly.

The students suppressed giggles.

"Alright, returning to Room....", the instructor breathed gingerly.

The class sniggered.

"Alright, returning to Slate....", the professor breathed mechanically.

The pupils listened in rapt attention.

"Alright, returning to Ginny, Ginny....", the instructor noted crudely.

The students watched quietly.

The bell blared.

"That's all the time we have. I hope you learned something today," the teacher muttered patiently.

The pupils filed out of the room mechanically.

# Lesson 4: Norrahammar Church

"Hello, class! Today we'll be learning about Norrahammar Church," the schoolteacher explained robotically.

The students sniggered.

The professor noted timidly, "Norrahammar -"

The educator halted, anticipating a question from the class about Norrahammar or some other topic.

The lecturer carried on.

The lecturer muttered confidently, "- Norrahammar Church (Swedish: Norrahammars kyrka) is a church building in Norrahammar in Sweden -"

"What's Sweden?" a student raised carefully.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a grin.

The schoolteacher announced timidly, "Sweden (Swedish: Sverige [ˈsvæ̌rjɛ] (listen)), officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: Konungariket Sverige [ˈkôːnɵŋaˌriːkɛt ˈsvæ̌rjɛ] (listen)), is a Nordic country -"

"What's Nordic country?" a student asked carefully.

The educator acknowledged the query with a nervous laugh.

The teacher muttered politely, "The Nordic countries (also known as the Nordics or Norden; lit. 'the North') are a geographical and cultural region in Northern Euro -"

"What's Euro?" a pupil questioned mechanically.

The instructor acknowledged the question with a grin.

The lecturer declared aggressively, "Euro -"

"What's Euro?" a boy queried carefully.

The educator disregarded the interruption and proceeded.

The teacher murmured robotically, "- Europe is a landmass located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere -"

The lecturer stopped, expecting a query from the pupils about Northern Hemisphere or some other topic.

The lecturer proceeded.

The educator breathed slowly, "- Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere -"

The teacher halted, anticipating a query from the students about Eastern Hemisphere or some other topic.

The students stifled their yawns.

The professor proceeded.

The teacher said aggressively, "- Eastern Hemisphere. It comprises the westernmost peninsulas of the continental landmass of Eurasia, it shares the continental landmass of Afro-Eurasia -"

"What's Afro-Eurasia?" a student quizzed happily.

The schoolteacher paid no attention to the interruption and carried on.

The ocean is the principal component of Earth's hydrosphere, and therefore integral to life on Earth. Acting as a huge heat reservoir, the ocean influences climate and weather patterns, the carbon cycle, and the water cycle. Oceanographers divide the ocean into different vertical and horizontal zones based on physical and biological conditions. The pelagic zone consists of the water column from surface to ocean floor throughout the open ocean. The water column is further categorized in other zones depending on depth and on how much light is present. The photic zone includes water from the surface to a depth of 1% of the surface light (about 200 m in the open ocean), where photosynthesis can occur. This makes the photic zone the most biodiverse. Photosynthesis -"

The schoolteacher took a breath, expecting a query from the students about Photosynthesis or some other topic.

The lecturer continued.

The lecturer breathed slowly, "- Photosynthesis by plants and microscopic algae (free floating phytoplankton) creates organic matter using light, water, carbon dioxide, and nutrients. Ocean photosynthesis creates 50% of the oxygen in earth's atmosphere. This upper sunlit zone is the origin of the food supply which sustains most of the ocean ecosystem. Light only penetrates to a depth of a few hundred meters; the remaining ocean below is cold and dark. The continental shelf where the ocean approaches dry land is more shallow, with a depth of a few hundred meters or less. Human activity has a greater impact on the continental shelf. Ocean temperatures depend on the amount of solar radiation reaching the ocean surface. In the tropics, surface temperatures can rise to over 30 °C (86 °F). Near the poles where sea ice forms, the temperature in equilibrium is about −2 °C (28 °F). Deep sea -"

"What's Deep sea?" a student queried quickly.

The professor acknowledged the question with a nervous laugh.

The teacher explained, "A republic (from Latin res publica 'public affair') is a form of government in which 'power is held by the people and their elected representatives'. In republics, the country is considered a 'public matter', not the private concern or property of the rulers. The primary positions of power within a republic are attained through democracy or a mix of democracy with oligarchy or autocracy rather than being unalterably occupied by any given family lineage or group. With modern republicanism, it has become the opposing form of government to a monarchy and therefore a modern republic has no monarch as head of state.As of 2017, 159 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word 'republic' as part of their official names. Not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor is the word 'republic' used in the names of all states with elected governments. The word republic comes from the Latin term res publica, which literally means 'public thing', 'public matter', or 'public affair' and was used to refer to the state as a whole. The term developed its modern meaning in reference to the constitution of the ancient Roman Republic, lasting from the overthrow of the kings in 509 BC to the establishment of the Empire -"

"What's Empire?" a student said sadly.

The professor acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The teacher said sadly, "An Empire is a sovereign state made up of several territories and peoples subject to a single ruling authority, often an emperor. A state can become an empire either by a narrow definition through having an emperor and being named as such, or by a broad definition as stated above as an aggregate territory under the rule of supreme authorities such as the Roman Empire. An empire can be made solely of contiguous territories, such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire -"

An Apple tvOS app is also in development.BBC Sounds differs from iPlayer Radio by acting as a place for original podcast material created by the BBC specifically for the app, as opposed to catch-up listening of its linear radio services. One example of this is the Beyond Today podcast, a daily online-only podcast produced by the Today team, exploring an issue in-depth with a younger audience in mind. The BBC has also announced plans to make podcasts from third-party producers available within the BBC Sounds service.The new service has caused controversy amongst some former users of the iPlayer Radio app, who claim that the functionality does not have the same features as before, and that the new app is not supported for older versions of smartphones. Some broadsheet newspapers have claimed that these changes disproportionately affect older listeners, particularly those who listen to speech and comedy content on BBC Radio -"

The teacher said patiently, "- BBC Red Button is a branding used for digital interactive television services provided by the BBC, and broadcast in the United Kingdom -"

"What's United Kingdom?" a boy queried patiently.

The lecturer paid no attention to the interruption and proceeded.

The schoolteacher breathed mechanically, "- United Kingdom. The services replaced Ceefax, the BBC's analogue teletext service. BBC Red Button's text services were due to close on 30 January 2020, but the switch off was suspended on 29 January 2020 following protests. The service was launched on 23 September 1999 as BBC Text. It was relaunched in November 2001 under the BBCi brand and operated under this name until late 2008, when it was rebranded as BBC Red Button. The 'red button' name refers to the common interface on remote controls for digital televisions and set-top boxes, a red push-button that launches digital teletext services. Although initially marketed as a spectacular new form of television, by 2008 this had given way to positioning iTV as ‘everyday’. This was due in part to the institutional landscape of television in the UK.In September 2009, the BBC celebrated 10 years of the digital interactive TV service. BBC Text originally launched on digital terrestrial services on 23 September 1999, and was later introduced on satellite and cable platforms. In the first phase, the service was created using content migrated from the existing analogue teletext service, Ceefax. A digital text service had been available since the launch of digital terrestrial television in November 1998, but the BBC Text service was not publicly launched until November 1999, due to a lack of availability of compatible set-top boxes. BBC Text was considerably more advanced than Ceefax, in that it offered a richer visual interface, with the possibility of photographic images and designed graphics (as opposed to Ceefax graphics which were composed of simple blocks of colour). BBC Text also enabled channel association, the ability for the user to retain their selected television channel visible in one section of the screen whilst viewing the text service, in contrast to Ceefax, which could only be viewed as a full-screen display, or as a semitransparent overlay (i.e. opaque blocks of colour on top of the television channel, with the black background now transparent; not 'translucent blocks of colour with a translucent black background') above the television picture. The original text service had no return path, this being made available in later phases. BBC Text pioneered an early form of 'on-demand' interactive television, called Enhanced TV. During the 1999 Wimbledon Championships -"

"What's 1999 Wimbledon Championships?" a boy questioned patiently.

The teacher disregarded the interruption and carried on.

"Well then, going back to BBC London....", the teacher announced quickly.

The pupils sat straighter in their seats.

"Now, turning back our attention to BBC London News....", the lecturer elaborated pointedly.

The educator said mechanically, "A republic (from Latin res publica 'public affair') is a form of government in which 'power is held by the people and their elected representatives'. In republics, the country is considered a 'public matter', not the private concern or property of the rulers. The primary positions of power within a republic are attained through democracy or a mix of democracy with oligarchy or autocracy rather than being unalterably occupied by any given family lineage or group. With modern republicanism, it has become the opposing form of government to a monarchy and therefore a modern republic has no monarch as head of state.As of 2017, 159 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word 'republic' as part of their official names. Not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor is the word 'republic' used in the names of all states with elected governments. The word republic comes from the Latin term res publica, which literally means 'public thing', 'public matter', or 'public affair' and was used to refer to the state as a whole. The term developed its modern meaning in reference to the constitution of the ancient Roman Republic -"

"What's Reason?" a girl demanded gently.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The instructor muttered slowly, "In geography, regions are areas that are broadly divided by physical characteristics (physical geography), human impact characteristics (human geography), and the interaction of humanity and the environment (environmental geography). Geographic regions and sub-regions are mostly described by their imprecisely defined, and sometimes transitory boundaries, except in human geography, where jurisdiction areas such as national borders are defined in law. Apart from the global continental regions, there are also hydrospheric and atmospheric regions that cover the oceans, and discrete climates above the land and water masses of the planet. The land and water global regions are divided into subregions geographically bounded by large geological features that influence large-scale ecologies, such as plains and features. As a way of describing spatial areas, the concept of regions is important and widely used among the many branches of geography, each of which can describe areas in regional terms. For example, ecoregion is a term used in environmental geography, cultural region in cultural geography, bioregion in biogeography, and so on. The field of geography that studies regions themselves is called regional geography. In the fields of physical geography, ecology, biogeography, zoogeography, and environmental geography, regions tend to be based on natural features such as ecosystems or biotopes, biomes, drainage basins, natural regions, mountain ranges, soil types. Where human geography is concerned, the regions and subregions are described by the discipline of ethnography. A region has its own nature that could not be moved. The first nature is its natural environment (landform, climate, etc.). The second nature is its physical elements complex that was built by people in the past. The third nature is its socio-cultural context that could not be replaced by new immigrants. Global regions distinguishable from space, and are therefore clearly distinguished by the two basic terrestrial environments, land and water. However, they have been generally recognized as such much earlier by terrestrial cartography because of their impact on human geography. They are divided into the largest of land regions, known as continents and the largest of water regions known as oceans. There are also significant regions that do not belong to either classification, such as archipelago regions that are littoral regions, or earthquake regions that are defined in geology. Continental regions are usually based on broad experiences in human history and attempt to reduce very large areas to more manageable regionalization for the purpose of the study. As such they are conceptual constructs, usually lacking distinct boundaries. The oceanic division into maritime regions is used in conjunction with the relationship to the central area of the continent, using directions of the compass. Some continental regions are defined by the major continental feature of their identity, such as the Amazon basin -"

The schoolteacher halted, expecting a query from the students about Amazon basin or some other topic.

The class listened in rapt attention.

The professor continued.

"Okay, getting back to Age of Enlightenment....", the lecturer seethed quietly.

The pupils sniggered.

The professor elaborated carefully, "- Reason or simply the Enlightenment) was an intellectual and philosophical movement that dominated the world of ideas in Europe during the 18th century. The Enlightenment included a range of ideas centered on the pursuit of happiness, sovereignty of reason, and the evidence of the senses as the primary sources of knowledge and advanced ideals such as liberty, progress, toleration, fraternity, constitutional government, and separation of church and state.The Enlightenment has its roots in a European intellectual and scholarly movement known as Renaissance -"

The professor disregarded the interruption and proceeded.

The teacher murmured furiously, "-  -"

"What's Hormone?" a student interjected quietly.

The educator acknowledged the question with a nervous laugh.

The instructor declared pointedly, "A hormone (from the Greek participle ὁρμῶν, 'setting in motion') is any member of a class of signaling molecules in multicellular organisms, that are transported to distant organs to regulate physiology and behavior. Hormones are required for the correct development of animals, plants and fungi. The lax definition of a hormone (as a signalling molecule that acts distant from its site of production) means that many different classes of molecule can be defined as hormones. Among the substances that can be considered hormones, are eicosanoids (e.g. prostaglandins and thromboxanes), steroids (e.g. oestrogen and brassinosteroid), amino acid derivatives (e.g. epinephrine and auxin), protein / peptides (e.g. insulin and CLE peptides) and gases (e.g ethylene and nitrous oxide). Hormones are used to communicate between organs and tissues. In vertebrates, hormones are responsible for the regulation of many physiological processes and behavioral activities such as digestion, metabolism, respiration, sensory perception, sleep, excretion, lactation, stress induction, growth and development, movement, reproduction, and mood manipulation. In plants, hormones modulate almost all aspects of development, from germination to senescence.Hormones affect distant cells by binding to specific receptor proteins in the target cell, resulting in a change in cell function. When a hormone binds to the receptor, it results in the activation of a signal transduction pathway that typically activates gene transcription, resulting in increased expression of target proteins. Hormones can also act in rapid, non-genomic pathways that can be synergistic with genomic effects. Water-soluble hormones (such as peptides and amines) generally act on the surface of target cells via second messengers. Lipid soluble hormones, (such as steroids) generally pass through the plasma membranes of target cells (both cytoplasmic and nuclear) to act within their nuclei. A notable exception to this are brassinosteroids in plants, which despite being lipid soluble, still bind to their receptor at the cell surface.In vertebrates, endocrine glands are specialized organs that secrete hormones into the endocrine signaling system. Hormone secretion occurs in response to specific biochemical signals and is often subject to negative feedback regulation. For instance, high blood sugar (serum glucose concentration) promotes insulin synthesis. Insulin then acts to reduce glucose levels and maintain homeostasis, leading to reduced insulin levels. Upon secretion water soluble hormones are readily transported through the circulatory system. Lipid-soluble hormones must bond to carrier plasma glycoproteins (e.g., thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG)) to form ligand-protein complexes. Some hormones are completely active when released into the bloodstream (as is the case for insulin and growth hormones), while others are prohormones that must be activated in specific cells through a series of activation steps that are commonly highly regulated. The endocrine system secretes hormones directly into the bloodstream, typically via fenestrated capillaries, whereas the exocrine system secretes its hormones indirectly using ducts. Hormones with paracrine function diffuse through the interstitial spaces to nearby target tissue. Plants lack specialized organs for the secretion of hormones, although there is spacial distribution of hormone production. For example, the hormone auxin is produced mainly at the tips of young leaves and in the shoot apical meristem. The lack of specialised glands means that the main site of hormone production can change throughout the life of a plant, and the site of production is dependent on the plant's age and environment. Hormonal signaling involves the following steps: Biosynthesis -"

"What's Biosynthesis?" a boy demanded.

The lecturer disregarded the interruption and continued.

"Okay, getting back to Birth....", the educator said.

The students listened in rapt attention.

"Alright, returning to Northern Hemisphere....", the teacher elaborated sadly.

The students watched quietly.

"Now then, back again to Seine-Maritime....", the lecturer sang patiently.

The pupils suppressed giggles.

"So, back again to Doudeville....", the professor muttered quickly.

"Good morning, class! Today we'll be talking about Prasophyllum pulchellum," the professor declared carefully.

The students suppressed giggles.

The teacher said excitedly, "Prasophyllum pulchellum, commonly known as the pretty leek orchid, is a species of orchid endemic to Tasmania. It has a single tubular, green leaf and up to twelve light reddish-brown flowers with a cream-coloured to whitish labellum. It is widely distributed in Tasmania and only about 130 plants are known but it is difficult to locate in the low heath where it grows and more individuals may survive. Prasophyllum pulchellum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single tube-shaped leaf which is 150–250 mm (6–10 in) long and 1.5–3 mm (0.06–0.1 in) wide near its purplish-red base. Between three and twelve light reddish-brown flowers are loosely arranged along a flowering spike which is 40–120 mm (2–5 in) long reaching to a height of 120–300 mm (5–10 in). The flowers are 5.5–7 mm (0.2–0.3 in) long and wide and as with other leek orchids, are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is lance-shaped to narrow egg-shaped, about 6 mm (0.2 in) long, 3 mm (0.1 in) wide and reddish-brown with three to five darker markings. The lateral sepals are linear to narrow lance-shaped, 6–7 mm (0.2–0.3 in) long, about 2 mm (0.08 in) wide and free from each other. The petals are linear, 5–6 mm (0.20–0.24 in) long, about 1.5 mm (0.06 in) wide and reddish-brown with pale edges. The labellum is cream-coloured to whitish, egg-shaped to lance-shaped, 6–7 mm (0.2–0.3 in) long, about 3 mm (0.1 in) wide and turns sharply upwards through about 90° near its middle. The edges of the upturned part of the labellum having crinkled, wavy edges and there is a shiny green, channelled callus in its centre extending just past the bend. Flowering occurs from late October through November. Prasophyllum pulchellum was first formally described in 1998 by David Jones from a specimen collected on South Bruny Island -"

"What's Bruny Island?" a girl wondered robotically.

The 326 Indian reservations in the United States are associated with specific Native American nations, often on a one-to-one basis. Some of the country's 574 federally recognized tribes govern more than one reservation, while some share reservations, and others have no reservation at all. In addition, because of past land allotments, leading to sales to non–Native Americans, some reservations are severely fragmented, with each piece of tribal, individual, and privately held land being a separate enclave. This jumble of private and public real estate creates significant administrative, political and legal difficulties.The collective geographical area of all reservations is 56,200,000 acres (22,700,000 ha; 87,800 sq mi; 227,000 km2), approximately the size of the state of Idaho -"

The schoolteacher paid no heed to the interruption and proceeded.

The schoolteacher murmured carefully, "- Seawater covers approximately 361,000,000 km2 (139,000,000 sq mi) of the planet. The ocean is the principal component of Earth's hydrosphere, and therefore integral to life on Earth. Acting as a huge heat reservoir, the ocean influences climate and weather patterns, the carbon cycle, and the water cycle. Oceanographers divide the ocean into different vertical and horizontal zones based on physical and biological conditions. The pelagic zone consists of the water column from surface to ocean floor throughout the open ocean. The water column is further categorized in other zones depending on depth and on how much light is present. The photic zone includes water from the surface to a depth of 1% of the surface light (about 200 m in the open ocean), where photosynthesis can occur. This makes the photic zone the most biodiverse. Photosynthesis by plants and microscopic algae (free floating phytoplankton) creates organic matter using light, water, carbon dioxide, and nutrients. Ocean photosynthesis creates 50% of the oxygen in earth's atmosphere. This upper sunlit zone is the origin of the food supply which sustains most of the ocean ecosystem. Light only penetrates to a depth of a few hundred meters; the remaining ocean below is cold and dark. The continental shelf where the ocean approaches dry land is more shallow, with a depth of a few hundred meters or less. Human activity has a greater impact on the continental shelf. Ocean temperatures depend on the amount of solar radiation reaching the ocean surface. In the tropics, surface temperatures can rise to over 30 °C (86 °F). Near the poles where sea ice forms, the temperature in equilibrium is about −2 °C (28 °F). Deep sea -"

"What's Deep sea?" a boy demanded happily.

The lecturer murmured timidly, "China (Chinese: 中国; pinyin: Zhōngguó; lit. 'Central State; Middle Kingdom'), officially the People's Republic -"

"What's Republic?" a boy questioned pointedly.

The instructor acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The lecturer sang furiously, "A republic (from Latin res publica 'public affair') is a form of government in which 'power is held by the people and their elected representatives'. In republics, the country is considered a 'public matter', not the private concern or property of the rulers. The primary positions of power within a republic are attained through democracy or a mix of democracy with oligarchy or autocracy rather than being unalterably occupied by any given family lineage or group. With modern republicanism, it has become the opposing form of government to a monarchy and therefore a modern republic has no monarch as head of state.As of 2017, 159 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word 'republic' as part of their official names. Not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor is the word 'republic' used in the names of all states with elected governments. The word republic comes from the Latin term res publica, which literally means 'public thing', 'public matter', or 'public affair' and was used to refer to the state as a whole. The term developed its modern meaning in reference to the constitution of the ancient Roman Republic, lasting from the overthrow of the kings in 509 BC to the establishment of the Empire -"

"What's Empire?" a student said carefully.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a nervous laugh.

The educator said calmly, "An Empire is a sovereign state made up of several territories and peoples subject to a single ruling authority, often an emperor.

"What's Roman Empire?" a student said.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The schoolteacher seethed aggressively, "The Roman Empire -"

"What's Empire?" a pupil said gently.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a nervous laugh.

The teacher muttered politely, "An Empire is a sovereign state made up of several territories and peoples subject to a single ruling authority, often an emperor. A state can become an empire either by a narrow definition through having an emperor and being named as such, or by a broad definition as stated above as an aggregate territory under the rule of supreme authorities such as the Roman Empire. An empire can be made solely of contiguous territories, such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire -"

"What's Austro-Hungarian Empire?" a girl quizzed carefully.

The educator disregarded the interruption and carried on.

The professor muttered excitedly, "- Austro-Hungarian Empire or the Russian Empire -"

"What's Russian Empire?" a boy raised carefully.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The educator paid no heed to the interruption and proceeded.

The teacher murmured breathlessly, "- Russian Empire, or include territories which are far remote from the 'home' country of the empire, such as a colonial empire. Aside from the more formal usage, the word empire can also refer colloquially to a large-scale business enterprise (e.g. a transnational corporation), a political organisation controlled by a single individual (a political boss), or a group (political bosses). The concept of empire is associated with other such concepts as imperialism, colonialism, and globalization, with imperialism referring to the creation and maintenance of unequal relationships between nations and not necessarily the policy of a state headed by an emperor or empress. Empire is often used as a term to describe displeasure to overpowering situations.There are two main ways to establish and maintain an imperial political structure: (i) as a territorial empire of direct conquest and control with force or (ii) as a coercive, hegemonic empire of indirect conquest and control with power. The former method provides greater tribute and direct political control, yet limits further expansion because it absorbs military forces to fixed garrisons. The latter method provides less tribute and indirect control, but avails military forces for further expansion. Territorial empires (e.g. the Macedonian Empire and Byzantine Empire -"

"What's Byzantine Empire?" a pupil raised aggressively.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The educator announced robotically, "The Byzantine -"

"What's Byzantine?" a pupil blurted sullenly.

The schoolteacher paid no heed to the interruption and continued.

The teacher elaborated mechanically, "- Byzantine Empire -"

"What's Empire?" a student piped up quickly.

The educator acknowledged the question with a nod.

The lecturer breathed, "An Empire is a sovereign state made up of several territories and peoples subject to a single ruling authority, often an emperor.

The instructor elaborated mechanically, "Austria -"

The lecturer paused, anticipating a question from the pupils about Austria or some other topic.

The educator muttered gently, "- Austria-Hungary, often referred to as the Austro-Hungarian Empire or the Dual Monarchy, was a constitutional monarchy and great power in Central Europe between 1867 and 1918. It was formed with the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 -"

The instructor stopped, expecting a query from the class about Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 or some other topic.

The teacher explained sullenly, "Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in North America and Oceania); gridiron football (specifically American football -"

The lecturer proceeded.

The professor elaborated calmly, "- Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby union and rugby league; and Gaelic football -"

The lecturer paused, expecting a question from the pupils about Gaelic football or some other topic.

The educator continued.

The instructor sang quietly, "- Gaelic football. These various forms of football share to varying extent common origins and are known as football codes. There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world. Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century. The expansion and cultural influence of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly controlled Empire. By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage. In 1888, The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football associations. During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world. The various codes of football share certain common elements and can be grouped into two main classes of football: carrying codes like American football, Canadian football, Australian football, rugby union and rugby league, where the ball is moved about the field while being held in the hands or thrown, and kicking codes such as Association football and Gaelic football, where the ball is moved primarily with the feet, and where handling is strictly limited.Common rules among the sports include: Two teams of usually between 11 and 18 players; some variations that have fewer players (five or more per team) are also popular. A clearly defined area in which to play the game. Scoring goals or points by moving the ball to an opposing team's end of the field and either into a goal area, or over a line. Goals or points resulting from players putting the ball between two goalposts. The goal or line being defended by the opposing team. Players using only their body to move the ball.In all codes, common skills include passing, tackling, evasion of tackles, catching and kicking. In most codes, there are rules restricting the movement of players offside, and players scoring a goal must put the ball either under or over a crossbar between the goalposts. There are conflicting explanations of the origin of the word 'football'. It is widely assumed that the word 'football' (or the phrase 'foot ball') refers to the action of the foot kicking a ball. There is an alternative explanation, which is that football originally referred to a variety of games in medieval Europe, which were played on foot. There is no conclusive evidence for either explanation. = = The Chinese competitive game cuju (蹴鞠) resembles modern association football (soccer), descriptions appear in a military manual dated to the second and third centuries BC. It existed during the Han dynasty -"

The teacher paused, anticipating a query from the class about Han dynasty or some other topic.

The students suppressed giggles.

The educator proceeded.

The professor seethed excitedly, "- National Basketball -"

"What's Basketball?" a girl raised quickly.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The professor elaborated sadly, "Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated. Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate, both of which require considerable skill. On offense, players may use a variety of shots – the layup, the jump shot, or a dunk; on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots; either offense or defense may collect a rebound, that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard. It is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling. The five players on each side fall into five playing positions. The tallest player is usually the center, the second-tallest and strongest is the power forward, a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward, and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard, who implements the coach's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays (player positioning). Informally, players may play three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one. Invented in 1891 by Canadian-America -"

The teacher took a breath, anticipating a query from the students about America or some other topic.

The schoolteacher carried on.

The schoolteacher murmured sadly, "- American gym teacher James Naismith in Springfield, Massachusetts -"

"What's Northeastern United States?" a student demanded quietly.

The teacher carried on.

The teacher muttered happily, "- Generally, when a muroid rodent is discovered, its common name includes the term mouse if it is smaller, or rat if it is larger. The common terms rat and mouse are not taxonomically specific. Typical mice are classified in the genus Mus, but the term mouse is not confined to members of Mus and can also apply to species from other genera such as the deer mouse, Peromyscus. Domestic mice sold as pets often differ substantially in size from the common house mouse. This is attributable to breeding and different conditions in the wild. The best-known strain of mouse is the white lab mouse. It has more uniform traits that are appropriate to its use in research. Cat -"

"What's Republic?" a boy said excitedly.

The professor acknowledged the query with a smile.

The educator explained timidly, "A republic (from Latin res publica 'public affair') is a form of government in which 'power is held by the people and their elected representatives'. In republics, the country is considered a 'public matter', not the private concern or property of the rulers. The primary positions of power within a republic are attained through democracy or a mix of democracy with oligarchy or autocracy rather than being unalterably occupied by any given family lineage or group. With modern republicanism, it has become the opposing form of government to a monarchy and therefore a modern republic has no monarch as head of state.As of 2017, 159 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word 'republic' as part of their official names. Not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor is the word 'republic' used in the names of all states with elected governments. The word republic comes from the Latin term res publica, which literally means 'public thing', 'public matter', or 'public affair' and was used to refer to the state as a whole. The term developed its modern meaning in reference to the constitution of the ancient Roman Republic -"

"What's Roman Republic?" a girl queried slowly.

The educator disregarded the interruption and carried on.

The teacher announced crudely, "- United States are associated with specific Native American nations, often on a one-to-one basis. Some of the country's 574 federally recognized tribes govern more than one reservation, while some share reservations, and others have no reservation at all. In addition, because of past land allotments, leading to sales to non–Native Americans, some reservations are severely fragmented, with each piece of tribal, individual, and privately held land being a separate enclave. This jumble of private and public real estate creates significant administrative, political and legal difficulties.The collective geographical area of all reservations is 56,200,000 acres (22,700,000 ha; 87,800 sq mi; 227,000 km2), approximately the size of the state of Idaho.

The main purpose of the RGB color model is for the sensing, representation, and display of images in electronic systems, such as televisions and computers, though it has also been used in conventional photography. Before the electronic age, the RGB color model already had a solid theory behind it, based in human perception of colors. RGB is a device-dependent color model: different devices detect or reproduce a given RGB value differently, since the color elements (such as phosphors or dyes) and their response to the individual red, green, and blue levels vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, or even in the same device over time. Thus an RGB value does not define the same color across devices without some kind of color management. Typical RGB input devices are color TV and video cameras, image scanners, and digital cameras. Typical RGB output devices are TV sets of various technologies (CRT, LCD, plasma, OLED -"

"What's Straits?" a pupil queried quickly.

The professor ignored the interruption and carried on.

The instructor noted crudely, "- Straits are also known to be loci for sediment accumulation. Usually, sand-size deposits occur on both the two opposite strait exits, forming subaqueous fans or deltas. The terms channel, pass, or passage can be synonymous and used interchangeably with strait, although each is sometimes differentiated with varying senses. In Scotland -"

A river which courses through a very tight meander is also sometimes said to form a 'peninsula' within the (almost closed) loop of water. A peninsula is land with bodies of water on three sides of it.There is no precise definition distinguishing peninsulas from less prominent extensions, and extensions conventionally considered peninsulas are not always named as such; they can also be referred to as a headland, cape, island promontory, bill, point, fork, or spit. A point is generally considered a piece of land projecting into a body of water that is less prominent than a cape. The area of peninsulas can range from tiny to very large. In English, the plural forms of peninsula are peninsulas or “sular” A form of the peninsula is the headland and the particularly narrow spit that has been washed up . If a peninsula is located in an inland body of water (lake, river) it is also referred to as an 'inland peninsula'. Barrier peninsula -"

The educator breathed aggressively, "A republic (from Latin res publica 'public affair') is a form of government in which 'power is held by the people and their elected representatives'. In republics, the country is considered a 'public matter', not the private concern or property of the rulers. The primary positions of power within a republic are attained through democracy or a mix of democracy with oligarchy or autocracy rather than being unalterably occupied by any given family lineage or group. With modern republicanism, it has become the opposing form of government to a monarchy and therefore a modern republic has no monarch as head of state.As of 2017, 159 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word 'republic' as part of their official names. Not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor is the word 'republic' used in the names of all states with elected governments. The word republic comes from the Latin term res publica, which literally means 'public thing', 'public matter', or 'public affair' and was used to refer to the state as a whole. The term developed its modern meaning in reference to the constitution of the ancient Roman Republic -"

"What's Empire?" a pupil blurted calmly.

The instructor acknowledged the question with a smile.

The schoolteacher explained slowly, "An Empire is a sovereign state made up of several territories and peoples subject to a single ruling authority, often an emperor. A state can become an empire either by a narrow definition through having an emperor and being named as such, or by a broad definition as stated above as an aggregate territory under the rule of supreme authorities such as the Roman Empire -"

The teacher paused, listening for a query from the class about Roman Empire or some other topic.

The students sniggered.

The teacher carried on.

The instructor declared quietly, "- Roman Empire. An empire can be made solely of contiguous territories, such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire or the Russia -"

"What's Russia?" a girl queried quietly.

The teacher disregarded the interruption and continued.

The lecturer muttered calmly, "- Russian Empire -"

"What's Russian Empire?" a boy blurted timidly.

The schoolteacher ignored the interruption and continued.

The teacher elaborated crudely, "- Russian Empire, or include territories which are far remote from the 'home' country of the empire, such as a colonial empire. Aside from the more formal usage, the word empire can also refer colloquially to a large-scale business enterprise (e.g. a transnational corporation), a political organisation controlled by a single individual (a political boss), or a group (political bosses). The concept of empire is associated with other such concepts as imperialism, colonialism, and globalization, with imperialism referring to the creation and maintenance of unequal relationships between nations and not necessarily the policy of a state headed by an emperor or empress. Empire is often used as a term to describe displeasure to overpowering situations.There are two main ways to establish and maintain an imperial political structure: (i) as a territorial empire of direct conquest and control with force or (ii) as a coercive, hegemonic empire of indirect conquest and control with power. The former method provides greater tribute and direct political control, yet limits further expansion because it absorbs military forces to fixed garrisons. The latter method provides less tribute and indirect control, but avails military forces for further expansion. Territorial empires (e.g. the Macedonian Empire and Byzantine Empire) tend to be contiguous areas. The term, on occasion, has been applied to maritime republics or thalassocracies (e.g. the Athenian and British empires) with looser structures and more scattered territories, often consisting of many islands and other forms of possessions which required the creation and maintenance of a powerful navy. Empires such as the Holy Roman Empire -"

The schoolteacher looked around, anticipating a question from the pupils about Holy Roman Empire or some other topic.

The teacher proceeded.

"Alright, going back to Republic....", the instructor muttered politely.

The students watched quietly.

"Now then, turning back our attention to Roman Republic....", the schoolteacher explained mechanically.
