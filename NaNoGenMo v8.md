# Lesson 1: Solid state ionics

"Hello and welcome, class! Today we'll be learning about Solid state ionics," the educator explained.

The students sat straighter in their seats.

The lecturer muttered gently, "Solid-state ionics is the study of ionic-electronic mixed conductor and fully ionic conductors (solid electrolytes) and their uses. Some materials that fall into this category include inorganic crystalline and polycrystalline solids, ceramics, glasses, polymers, and composites. Solid-state ionic devices, such as solid oxide fuel cells, can be much more reliable and long-lasting, especially under harsh conditions, than comparable devices with fluid electrolytes.The field of solid-state ionics was first developed in Europe, starting with the work of Michael Faraday -"

"Who's Michael Faraday?" a boy interjected pointedly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The instructor disregarded the interruption and carried on.

The professor said gently, "- Michael Faraday on solid electrolytes Ag2S and PbF2 in 1834. Fundamental contributions were later made by Walther Nernst -"

"Who's Walther Nernst?" a girl quizzed quickly.

The professor acknowledged the query with a nod.

The educator announced slowly, "Walther Hermann Nernst (German pronunciation: [ˈvaltɐ ˈnɛʁnst] (listen); 25 June 1864 – 18 November 1941) was a German chemist known for his work in thermodynamics, physical chemistry, electrochemistry, and solid state physics. His formulation of the Nernst heat theorem -"

"What's Nernst heat theorem?" a boy wondered crudely.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a nod.

The lecturer noted gingerly, "The Nernst heat theorem was formulated by Walther Nernst -"

"Who's Walther Nernst?" a girl piped up happily.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The educator explained patiently, "Walther Hermann Nernst (German pronunciation: [ˈvaltɐ ˈnɛʁnst] (listen); 25 June 1864 – 18 November 1941) was a German chemist known for his work in thermodynamics, physical chemistry, electrochemistry, and solid state physics. His formulation of the Nernst heat theorem helped pave the way for the third law of thermodynamics, for which he won the 1920 Nobel Prize -"

The educator took a breath, listening for a question from the students about Nobel Prize or some other topic.

The lecturer continued.

The instructor said carefully, "- Nobel Prize in Chemistry -"

The professor halted, expecting a question from the class about Nobel Prize in Chemistry or some other topic.

The instructor proceeded.

The schoolteacher murmured mechanically, "- Nobel Prize in Chemist -"

"What's Chemist?" a girl asked carefully.

The professor acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The professor declared, "Chemistry is the scientific study of the properties and behavior of matter. It is a natural science that covers the elements that make up matter to the compounds composed of atoms, molecules and ions: their composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other substances.In the scope of its subject, chemistry occupies an intermediate position between physics and biology. It is sometimes called the central science because it provides a foundation for understanding both basic and applied scientific disciplines at a fundamental level. For example, chemistry explains aspects of plant chemistry (botany), the formation of igneous rocks (geology), how atmospheric ozone is formed and how environmental pollutants are degraded (ecology), the properties of the soil on the moon (cosmochemistry), how medications work (pharmacology), and how to collect DNA -"

The teacher stopped, expecting a query from the students about DNA or some other topic.

The class listened in rapt attention.

The lecturer proceeded.

The schoolteacher said patiently, "- DNA evidence at a crime scene (forensics). Chemistry addresses topics such as how atoms and molecules interact via chemical bonds to form new chemical compounds. There are two types of chemical bonds: 1. primary chemical bonds e.g covalent bonds, in which atoms share one or more electron(s); ionic bonds, in which an atom donates one or more electrons to another atom to produce ions (cations and anions); metallic bonds and 2. secondary chemical bonds e.g. hydrogen bonds; Van der Waals force -"

The professor took a breath, expecting a question from the pupils about Van der Waals force or some other topic.

The pupils watched quietly.

The schoolteacher carried on.

The professor noted sullenly, "- Van der Waals force bonds, ion-ion interaction, ion-dipole interaction etc. The word chemistry comes from a modification of the word alchemy, which referred to an earlier set of practices that encompassed elements of chemistry, metallurgy, philosophy, astrology, astronomy, mysticism and medicine. Alchemy -"

The teacher took a breath, expecting a question from the pupils about Alchemy or some other topic.

The students sniggered.

The educator proceeded.

The educator murmured quickly, "- Alchemy is often seen as linked to the quest to turn lead or other base metals into gold, though alchemists were also interested in many of the questions of modern chemistry.The modern word alchemy in turn is derived from the Arabic -"

The teacher looked around, waiting for a query from the pupils about Arabic or some other topic.

The pupils watched quietly.

The lecturer carried on.

The lecturer elaborated robotically, "- Arabic word al-kīmīā (الكیمیاء). This may have Egyptian origins since al-kīmīā is derived from the Ancient Greek -"

"What's Ancient Greek?" a pupil asked robotically.

The professor ignored the interruption and proceeded.

The professor elaborated breathlessly, "- Ancient Greek χημία, which is in turn derived from the word Kemet, which is the ancient name of Egypt in the Egyptian language. Alternately, al-kīmīā may derive from χημεία 'cast together'. The current model of atomic structure is the quantum mechanical model. Traditional chemistry starts with the study of elementary particles, atoms, molecules, substances, metals, crystals and other aggregates of matter. Matter -"

"What's Matter?" a girl demanded patiently.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a grin.

The lecturer ignored the interruption and carried on.

The schoolteacher breathed patiently, "- Matter can be studied in solid, liquid, gas and plasma states, in isolation or in combination. The interactions, reactions and transformations that are studied in chemistry are usually the result of interactions between atoms, leading to rearrangements of the chemical bonds which hold atoms together. Such behaviors are studied in a chemistry laboratory. The chemistry laboratory stereotypically uses various forms of laboratory glassware. However glassware is not central to chemistry, and a great deal of experimental (as well as applied/industrial) chemistry is done without it. A chemical reaction is a transformation of some substances into one or more different substances. The basis of such a chemical transformation is the rearrangement of electrons in the chemical bonds between atoms. It can be symbolically depicted through a chemical equation, which usually involves atoms as subjects. The number of atoms on the left and the right in the equation for a chemical transformation is equal. (When the number of atoms on either side is unequal, the transformation is referred to as a nuclear reaction or radioactive decay.) The type of chemical reactions a substance may undergo and the energy changes that may accompany it are constrained by certain basic rules, known as chemical laws. Energy and entropy considerations are invariably important in almost all chemical studies. Chemical substance -"

The instructor halted, waiting for a question from the pupils about Chemical substance or some other topic.

The students stifled their yawns.

The professor proceeded.

"Now, getting back to Walther Nernst....", the lecturer said robotically.

The pupils suppressed giggles.

"Well then, going back to Nernst heat theorem....", the teacher announced sadly.

The pupils sniggered.

"Okay, turning back our attention to Walther Nernst....", the professor elaborated mechanically.

The class watched quietly.

The educator murmured carefully, "- Nernst heat theorem helped pave the way for the third law of thermodynamics, for which he won the 1920 Nobel Prize -"

The lecturer took a breath, listening for a query from the class about Nobel Prize or some other topic.

The class suppressed giggles.

The schoolteacher proceeded.

The educator murmured sullenly, "- Nobel Prize in Chemistry -"

The teacher took a breath, waiting for a query from the class about Nobel Prize in Chemistry or some other topic.

The pupils stifled their yawns.

The teacher proceeded.

The educator explained pointedly, "- Nobel Prize in Chemist -"

The lecturer paused, waiting for a query from the pupils about Chemist or some other topic.

The class watched quietly.

The teacher carried on.

The instructor noted timidly, "- Chemistry -"

The schoolteacher took a breath, waiting for a query from the pupils about Chemistry or some other topic.

The teacher carried on.

"Well then, returning to Solid state ionics....", the schoolteacher declared robotically.

The students stifled their yawns.

The professor noted patiently, "- Walther Nernst, who derived the Nernst equation -"

"What's Nernst equation?" a boy said quietly.

The instructor acknowledged the question with a grin.

The educator announced quietly, "In electrochemistry, the Nernst equation is a chemical thermodynamical relationship allowing to calculate the reduction potential of a reaction (half-cell or full cell reaction) from the standard electrode potential, absolute temperature, the number of electrons involved in the oxydo-reduction reaction, and activities (often approximated by concentrations) of the chemical species undergoing reduction and oxidation respectively. It was named after Walther Nernst -"

The schoolteacher took a breath, anticipating a question from the pupils about Walther Nernst or some other topic.

The class watched quietly.

The teacher continued.

The lecturer seethed crudely, "- Walther Nernst, a German physical chemist who formulated the equation. When an oxidizer (Ox) accepts a number z of electrons ( e−) to be converted in its reduced form (Red), the half-reaction is expressed as: Ox + z e− → RedThe reaction quotient (Qr), also often called the ion activity product (IAP), is the ratio between the chemical activities (a) of the reduced form (the reductant, aRed) and the oxidized form (the oxidant, aOx). The chemical activity of a dissolved species corresponds to its true thermodynamic concentration taking into account the electrical interactions between all ions present in solution at elevated concentrations. For a given dissolved species, its chemical activity (a) is the product of its activity coefficient (γ) by its molar (mol/L solution), or molal (mol/kg water), concentration (C): a = γ C. So, if the concentration (C, also denoted here below with square brackets [ ]) of all the dissolved species of interest are sufficiently low and that their activity coefficients are close to unity, their chemical activities can be approximated by their concentrations as commonly done when simplifying, or idealizing, a reaction for didactic purposes: Q r = a Red a Ox = [ R e d ] [ O x ] {\displaystyle Q_{r}={\frac {a_{\text{Red}}}{a_{\text{Ox}}}}={\frac {[Red]}{[Ox]}}} At chemical equilibrium, the ratio Qr of the activity of the reaction product (aRed) by the reagent activity (aOx) is equal to the equilibrium constant K of the half-reaction: K = a Red a Ox {\displaystyle K={\frac {a_{\text{Red}}}{a_{\text{Ox}}}}} The standard thermodynamics also says that the actual Gibbs free energy -"

"What's Gibbs free energy?" a pupil wondered patiently.

The schoolteacher paid no heed to the interruption and carried on.

The professor noted politely, "- Gibbs free energy ΔG is related to the free energy change under standard state ΔGo by the relationship: where Qr is the reaction quotient. The cell potential E associated with the electrochemical reaction is defined as the decrease in Gibbs free energy per coulomb of charge transferred, which leads to the relationship The constant F (the Faraday constant) is a unit conversion factor F = NAq, where NA is the Avogadro constant -"

The instructor took a breath, anticipating a question from the students about Avogadro constant or some other topic.

The pupils sat straighter in their seats.

The lecturer continued.

The professor murmured timidly, "- Avogadro constant and q is the fundamental electron charge. This immediately leads to the Nernst equation, which for an electrochemical half-cell is For a complete electrochemical reaction (full cell), the equation can be written as where: Ered is the half-cell reduction potential at the temperature of interest, Eored is the standard half-cell reduction potential, Ecell is the cell potential (electromotive force) at the temperature of interest, Eocell is the standard cell potential, R is the universal gas constant: R = 8.31446261815324 J K−1 mol−1, T is the temperature in kelvins, z is the number of electrons transferred in the cell reaction or half-reaction, F is the Faraday constant, the number of coulombs per mole of electrons: F = 96485.3321233100184 C mol−1, Qr is the reaction quotient of the cell reaction, and a is the chemical activity for the relevant species, where aRed is the activity of the reduced form and aOx is the activity of the oxidized form. Similarly to equilibrium constants, activities are always measured with respect to the standard state (1 mol/L for solutes, 1 atm for gases, and T = 298.15 K, i.e., 25 °C or 77 °F). The chemical activity of a species i, ai, is related to the measured concentration Ci via the relationship ai = γi Ci, where γi is the activity coefficient of the species i. Because activity coefficients tend to unity at low concentrations, activities in the Nernst equation are frequently replaced by simple concentrations. Taking into account the activity coefficients ( γ {\displaystyle \gamma } ) the Nernst equation becomes: Where the first term ( E red ⊖ − R T z F ln ⁡ γ Red γ Ox ) {\displaystyle \left(E_{\text{red}}^{\ominus }-{\frac {RT}{zF}}\ln {\frac {\gamma _{\text{Red}}}{\gamma _{\text{Ox}}}}\right)} is denoted E red ⊖ ′ {\displaystyle E_{\text{red}}^{\ominus '}} and called the formal reduction potential, so that: Thus, when the activity coefficients are far from unity and can no longer be simply neglected, it can be convenient to introduce the notion of the 'so-called' standard formal reduction potential ( E red ⊖ ′ {\displaystyle E_{\text{red}}^{\ominus '}} ) which is related to the standard reduction potential as follows: So that the Nernst equation for the half-cell reaction can be correctly formally written in terms of concentrations as: and likewise for the full cell expression. According to Wenzel (2020), a formal reduction potential E red ⊖ ′ {\displaystyle E_{\text{red}}^{\ominus '}} is the reduction potential that applies to a half reaction under a set of specified conditions such as, e.g., pH, ionic strength, or the concentration of complexing agents. The formal reduction potential E red ⊖ ′ {\displaystyle E_{\text{red}}^{\ominus '}} is often a more convenient, but conditional, form of the standard reduction potential, taking into account activity coefficients and specific conditions characteristics of the reaction medium. Therefore, its value is a conditional value, i.e., that it depends on the experimental conditions and because the ionic strength affects the activity coefficients, E red ⊖ ′ {\displaystyle E_{\text{red}}^{\ominus '}} will vary from medium to medium.Formal standard reduction potentials ( E red ⊖ ′ {\displaystyle E_{\text{red}}^{\ominus '}} ) are commonly used in biochemistry and cell biology for referring to standard reduction potentials measured at pH 7, a value closer to the pH of most physiological and intracellular fluids than the standard state pH of 0. The advantage is to defining a more appropriate redox scale better corresponding to real conditions than the standard state. Formal standard reduction potentials ( E red ⊖ ′ {\displaystyle E_{\text{red}}^{\ominus '}} ) allow to more easily estimate if a redox reaction supposed to occur in a metabolic process or to fuel microbial activity under some conditions is feasible or not. Formal reduction potentials are also applied in electrochemistry and geochemistry to simplify results interpretations and the modelling of the considered system: in this case, the relationship with the standard reduction potentials must be clearly expressed to avoid any confusion. While, standard reduction potentials always refer to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE), with [ H+] = 1 M corresponding to a pH 0, and E red H+ ⊖ {\displaystyle E_{\text{red H+}}^{\ominus }} fixed to zero by definition, it is no longer the case at a pH of 7. Then, the H+ reduction potential value is -0.41 volt with respect to the SHE. Indeed, solving the Nernst equation for the half-reaction of reduction of two protons into hydrogen gas: 2 H+ + 2 e− → H2 It gives: E red = E red ⊖ − 0.059 V 2 log 10 ⁡ P H 2 ( a H + ) 2 {\displaystyle E_{\text{red}}=E_{\text{red}}^{\ominus }-{\frac {0.059\ V}{2}}\log _{10}{\frac {P_{H_{2}}}{\left(a_{H^{+}}\right)^{2}}}} or, E red = 0 − 0.059 V 2 log 10 ⁡ 1 ( 10 − 7 ) 2 = 0 − 0.059 V 2 log 10 ⁡ 10 14 = 0 − 0.059 V 2 14 = − 0.413 V {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}E_{\text{red}}&=0-{\frac {0.059\ V}{2}}\log _{10}{\frac {1}{\left(10^{-7}\right)^{2}}}\\&=0-{\frac {0.059\ V}{2}}\log _{10}10^{14}\\&=0-{\frac {0.059\ V}{2}}\ 14\\&=-0.413\operatorname {V} \end{aligned}}} So, E red = − 0.413 V {\displaystyle E_{\text{red}}=-0.413\operatorname {V} } versus the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) for a hydrogen electrode operating at pH 7, as also reported by Voet et al. (2016). = = The main factor affecting the formal reduction potentials in biochemical or biological processes is most often the pH. To determine approximate values of formal reduction potentials, neglecting in a first approach changes in activity coefficients due to ionic strength, the Nernst equation has to be applied taking care to first express the relationship as a function of pH. The second factor to be considered are the values of the concentrations taken into account in the Nernst equation. To define a formal reduction potential for a biochemical reaction, the pH value, the concentrations values and the hypotheses made on the activity coefficients must always be clearly indicated. When using, or comparing, several formal reduction potentials they must also be internally consistent. Problems may occur when mixing different sources of data using different conventions or approximations (i.e., with different underlying hypotheses). When working at the frontier between inorganic and biological processes (e.g., when comparing abiotic and biotic processes in geochemistry when microbial activity could also be at work in the system), care must be taken not to inadvertently directly mix standard reduction potentials versus SHE (pH = 0) with formal reduction potentials (pH = 7). Definitions must be clearly expressed and carefully controlled, especially if the sources of data are different and arise from different fields (e.g., picking data from classical electrochemistry and microbiology textbooks without paying attention to the conventions). = = To illustrate the dependency of the reduction potential on pH, one can simply consider the two oxido-reduction equilibria determining the water stability domain in a Pourbaix diagram -"

"What's Pourbaix diagram?" a boy interjected pointedly.

The professor paid no heed to the interruption and continued.

"Now then, returning to Solid state ionics....", the schoolteacher said happily.

The class watched quietly.

The bell rang.

"That's all the time we have. I hope you learned something today," the educator elaborated gingerly.

The class crowded out of the room pointedly.

# Lesson 2: Business-to-business

"Good morning, class! Today we'll be studying Business-to-business," the instructor announced slowly.

The class listened in rapt attention.

The teacher breathed quietly, "Business-to-business (B2B or, in some countries, BtoB) is a situation where one business makes a commercial transaction with another. This typically occurs when: A business is sourcing materials for their production process for output (e.g., a food manufacturer purchasing salt), i.e. providing raw material to the other company that will produce output. A business needs the services of another for operational reasons (e.g., a food manufacturer employing an accountancy firm to audit their finances). A business re-sells goods and services produced by others (e.g., a retailer buying the end product from the food manufacturer).B2B is often contrasted with business-to-consumer (B2C). In B2B commerce, it is often the case that the parties to the relationship have comparable negotiating power, and even when they do not, each party typically involves professional staff and legal counsel in the negotiation of terms, whereas B2C is shaped to a far greater degree by economic implications of information asymmetry. However, within a B2B context, large companies may have many commercial, resource and information advantages over smaller businesses. The United Kingdom government, for example, created the post of Small Business Commissioner -"

"What's Small Business Commissioner?" a girl queried sadly.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a nod.

The professor elaborated quietly, "The Small Business Commissioner was established by the UK government in the Enterprise Act of 2016. Secretary of State for Business Greg Clark announced the appointment of Paul Uppal to the newly established post of Small Business Commissioner on 2 October 2017. On 20 December 2017, working with digital agency 'dxw digital', an advice and complaints service was launched to help small businesses get paid on time and ensure fair payment practices. The role of the office of Small Business Commissioner is to provide general information and advice to small businesses about payment issues with larger businesses, and direct them to services to help them resolve their payment issues. The Commissioner also offers a complaint service. Supporting the Britain's 5.5 million small businesses is a priority outlined in the UK government’s Industrial Strategy. The Small Business Commissioner was established as a non-departmental public body by the Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy. It was announced in a discussion paper issued in July 2015 and was formally proposed for creation within the Enterprise Bill introduced into the UK Parliament -"

The lecturer paused, anticipating a query from the pupils about UK Parliament or some other topic.

The class watched quietly.

The educator carried on.

The instructor announced timidly, "- UK Parliament in September 2015.Anna Soubry MP, the Minister of State for Small Business, Industry and Enterprise within the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy -"

"What's Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy?" a boy said slowly.

The professor acknowledged the question with a smile.

The teacher seethed aggressively, "The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) is a department of the government of the United Kingdom. The department was formed during a machinery of government change on 14 July 2016, following Theresa May -"

The educator took a breath, listening for a query from the class about Theresa May or some other topic.

The students suppressed giggles.

The schoolteacher proceeded.

The educator elaborated pointedly, "- Theresa May's appointment as Prime Minister, through a merger between the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills -"

The educator looked around, listening for a query from the students about Department of Energy and Climate Change or some other topic.

The pupils sat straighter in their seats.

The educator carried on.

The teacher breathed furiously, "- Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC). The Ministers in the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy are: In October 2016, Archie Norman was appointed as Lead Non Executive Board Member for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. The department has responsibility for: business industrial strategy science, research and innovation energy and clean growth climate change While some functions of the former Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, in respect of higher and further education policy, apprenticeships and skills, were transferred to the Department for Education -"

The schoolteacher looked around, expecting a question from the class about Department for Education or some other topic.

The students watched quietly.

The teacher continued.

The professor seethed excitedly, "- Department for Education, in a statement May explained:The Department for Energy and Climate Change and the remaining functions of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills have been merged to form a new Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, bringing together responsibility for business, industrial strategy, and science and innovation with energy and climate change policy. The new department will be responsible for helping to ensure that the economy grows strongly in all parts of the country, based on a robust industrial strategy. It will ensure that the UK has energy supplies that are reliable, affordable and clean; and it will make the most of the economic opportunities of new technologies, and support the UK’s global competitiveness more effectively. Some responsibilities extend to England -"

The teacher looked around, listening for a query from the pupils about England or some other topic.

The pupils stifled their yawns.

The professor continued.

The professor muttered sullenly, "- England alone due to devolution, while others are reserved or excepted matters that therefore apply to the other countries of the United Kingdom as well. Reserved and excepted matters -"

"What's Reserved and excepted matters?" a pupil asked crudely.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The schoolteacher noted patiently, "In the United Kingdom -"

"What's United Kingdom?" a girl wondered robotically.

The instructor acknowledged the question with a nod.

The schoolteacher announced timidly, "The United Kingdom of Great Britain -"

The schoolteacher took a breath, waiting for a query from the class about Great Britain or some other topic.

The students sniggered.

The teacher proceeded.

The schoolteacher explained happily, "- Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in north-western Europe, off the north-­western coast of the European mainland. The United Kingdom includes the island of Great Britain, the north-­eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands within the British Isles -"

The instructor stopped, waiting for a query from the pupils about British Isles or some other topic.

The pupils stifled their yawns.

The lecturer continued.

The lecturer noted confidently, "- British Isles. Northern Ireland shares a land border with the Republic of Ireland -"

The instructor paused, anticipating a query from the pupils about Republic of Ireland or some other topic.

The teacher carried on.

The schoolteacher muttered, "- Republic of Ireland. Otherwise, the United Kingdom is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east, the English Channel -"

The educator stopped, anticipating a query from the class about English Channel or some other topic.

The pupils listened in rapt attention.

The professor continued.

The educator breathed quietly, "- English Channel to the south and the Celtic Sea -"

The lecturer took a breath, listening for a question from the students about Celtic Sea or some other topic.

The class listened in rapt attention.

The professor continued.

The schoolteacher sang gently, "- Celtic Sea to the south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea separates Great Britain and Ireland. The total area of the United Kingdom is 242,500 square kilometres (93,628 sq mi), with an estimated population in 2020 of 68 million.The United Kingdom is a unitary parliamentary democracy and constitutional monarchy. The monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, has reigned since 1952. The capital and largest city is London -"

"What's London?" a boy asked gingerly.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a grin.

The lecturer seethed sullenly, "London is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom. It stands on the River Thames -"

"What's River Thames?" a boy interjected mechanically.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a smile.

The instructor paid no heed to the interruption and continued.

The schoolteacher announced slowly, "- River Thames in south-east England at the head of a 50-mile (80 km) estuary down to the North Sea, and has been a major settlement for two millennia. The City of London, its ancient core and financial centre, was founded by the Romans as Londinium -"

The instructor looked around, waiting for a question from the pupils about Londinium or some other topic.

The class sat straighter in their seats.

The educator proceeded.

The schoolteacher sang carefully, "- Londinium and retains boundaries close to its medieval ones. Since the 19th century, 'London' has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between the counties of Middlesex, Essex, Surrey -"

The lecturer looked around, expecting a question from the pupils about Surrey or some other topic.

The class sat straighter in their seats.

The instructor proceeded.

The instructor explained breathlessly, "- Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which largely makes up Greater London -"

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a grin.

The lecturer ignored the interruption and proceeded.

The schoolteacher noted excitedly, "- Greater London, the region governed by the Greater London Authority -"

"What's Greater London Authority?" a pupil queried pointedly.

The teacher paid no heed to the interruption and proceeded.

The educator murmured, "- Greater London Authority. The City of Westminster, to the west of the City, has for centuries held the national government and parliament. London, as one of the world's global cities, exerts strong influence on its arts, commerce, education, entertainment, fashion, finance, health care, media, tourism and communications.

The instructor sang timidly, "- United States are associated with specific Native American nations, often on a one-to-one basis. Some of the country's 574 federally recognized tribes govern more than one reservation, while some share reservations, and others have no reservation at all. In addition, because of past land allotments, leading to sales to non–Native Americans, some reservations are severely fragmented, with each piece of tribal, individual, and privately held land being a separate enclave. This jumble of private and public real estate creates significant administrative, political and legal difficulties.The collective geographical area of all reservations is 56,200,000 acres (22,700,000 ha; 87,800 sq mi; 227,000 km2), approximately the size of the state of Idaho -"

Initiated in 1991, the database was first made available on the Internet in 1994. AllMusic is owned by RhythmOne. AllMusic was launched as All Music Guide by Michael Erlewine, a 'compulsive archivist, noted astrologer, Buddhist scholar and musician'. He became interested in using computers for his astrological work in the mid-1970s and founded a software company, Matrix, in 1977. In the early 1990s, as CDs replaced LPs as the dominant format for recorded music, Erlewine purchased what he thought was a CD of early recordings by Little Richard -"

Around 3,500 were manufactured in all. Early versions of the B.E.2 entered squadron service with the Royal Flying Corps -"

The lecturer paused, waiting for a question from the students about Royal Flying Corps or some other topic.

The class suppressed giggles.

The lecturer proceeded.

The educator elaborated, "- Royal Flying Corps in 1912; the type continued to serve throughout the First World War. It was initially used as a front-line reconnaissance aircraft and light bomber; modified as a single-seater it proved effective as a night fighter, destroying several German airships. By late 1915, the B.E.2 was proving inadequate in defending itself against German fighters such as the then-new Fokker Eindecker -"

The professor took a breath, waiting for a query from the pupils about Fokker Eindecker or some other topic.

The professor proceeded.

The instructor said confidently, "- Fokker Eindecker, leading to increased losses during the period known as the Fokker Scourge. Although by now obsolete, it had to remain on the front line while suitable replacements were designed, tested and brought into service. Following its belated withdrawal from operations, the type served in various second-line capacities, seeing use as a trainer and communications aircraft, as well as performing anti-submarine coastal patrol duties. The B.E.2 has always been a subject of controversy, both at the time and in later historical assessment. From the B.E.2c variant on it had been carefully adapted to be 'inherently stable'; this feature was considered helpful in its artillery observation and aerial photography duties, most of which were assigned to the pilot, who was able to fly without constant attention to his flight controls. Despite a tendency to swing on takeoff and a reputation for spinning, the type had a relatively low accident rate. The stability of the type was however achieved at the expense of heavy controls, making rapid manoeuvring difficult. The observer, often not carried because of the B.E.'s poor payload, occupied the front seat, where he had a limited field of fire for his gun. The B.E.2 was one of the first fixed-wing aircraft to be designed at what was then called the Royal Balloon Factory (the organisation was formally renamed as the Royal Aircraft Factory on 26 April 1911). The team responsible for its design came under the direction of British engineer Mervyn O'Gorman -"

The teacher breathed patiently, "- Spain, most notably the Spanish-speaking countries of the Americas -"

The teacher paused, expecting a question from the class about Americas or some other topic.

The students sniggered.

The schoolteacher carried on.

The educator explained crudely, "- Americas. The term commonly applies to countries with a cultural and historical link to Spain and to colonies formerly part of the Spanish Empire -"

The professor halted, waiting for a question from the students about Spanish Empire or some other topic.

The lecturer proceeded.

The professor noted, "- Spanish Empire following the Spanish colonization of the Americas, parts of the Asia-Pacific region and Africa. These are mainly countries of Hispanic America -"

The schoolteacher took a breath, anticipating a query from the pupils about Hispanic America or some other topic.

The students watched quietly.

The schoolteacher carried on.

The lecturer elaborated breathlessly, "- Hispanic America, Philippines -"

"What's Philippines?" a boy piped up sadly.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The instructor muttered sadly, "The Philippine -"

The professor looked around, expecting a query from the pupils about Philippine or some other topic.

The students listened in rapt attention.

The lecturer continued.

The instructor declared excitedly, "- Philippines ( (listen); Filipino: Pilipinas), officially the Republic -"

"What's Republic?" a student demanded furiously.

The professor acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The schoolteacher said breathlessly, "A republic (from Latin res publica 'public affair') is a form of government in which 'power is held by the people and their elected representatives'. In republics, the country is considered a 'public matter', not the private concern or property of the rulers. The primary positions of power within a republic are attained through democracy or a mix of democracy with oligarchy or autocracy rather than being unalterably occupied by any given family lineage or group. With modern republicanism, it has become the opposing form of government to a monarchy and therefore a modern republic has no monarch as head of state.As of 2017, 159 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word 'republic' as part of their official names. Not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor is the word 'republic' used in the names of all states with elected governments. The word republic comes from the Latin term res publica, which literally means 'public thing', 'public matter', or 'public affair' and was used to refer to the state as a whole. The term developed its modern meaning in reference to the constitution of the ancient Roman Republic -"

"What's Roman Republic?" a student wondered calmly.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The teacher said gingerly, "The Roman Republic -"

The teacher paused, expecting a query from the class about Republic or some other topic.

The pupils stifled their yawns.

The teacher carried on.

The schoolteacher muttered carefully, "- Republic (Latin: Rēs pūblica Rōmāna [ˈreːs ˈpuːblika roːˈmaːna]) was a state of the classical Roman civilization, run through public representation of the Roman people -"

"What's Roman people?" a boy interjected quickly.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a nervous laugh.

The professor declared furiously, "The Romans (Latin: Rōmānī; Ancient Greek -"

"What's Ancient Greek?" a girl said excitedly.

The professor acknowledged the question with a smile.

The educator sang crudely, "Ancient Greek includes the forms of the Greek language -"

"What's Greek language?" a pupil questioned crudely.

The instructor ignored the interruption and continued.

The instructor muttered timidly, "- Greek language used in ancient Greece -"

The educator halted, anticipating a query from the class about Greece or some other topic.

The students sat straighter in their seats.

The instructor continued.

The lecturer announced crudely, "- Greece and the ancient world from around 1500 BC to 300 BC. It is often roughly divided into the following periods: Mycenaean Greek -"

"What's Mycenaean Greek?" a girl asked patiently.

The instructor acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The teacher noted slowly, "Mycenae -"

"Who's Mycenae?" a student piped up aggressively.

The educator acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The professor ignored the interruption and carried on.

The lecturer seethed quietly, "- Mycenaean Greek is the most ancient attested form of the Greek language -"

"What's Greek language?" a pupil wondered excitedly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the query with a grin.

The professor muttered slowly, "Greek (Modern Greek -"

"What's Modern Greek?" a student interjected carefully.

The instructor acknowledged the query with a nod.

The teacher muttered pointedly, "Modern Greek (Νέα Ελληνικά, Néa Elliniká, [ˈne.a eliniˈka] or Κοινή Νεοελληνική Γλώσσα, Kiní Neoellinikí Glóssa), generally referred to by speakers simply as Greek (Ελληνικά, Elliniká), refers collectively to the dialects of the Greek language -"

The teacher looked around, listening for a question from the students about Greek language or some other topic.

The pupils stifled their yawns.

The schoolteacher continued.

The educator declared pointedly, "- Greek language spoken in the modern era, including the official standardized form of the languages sometimes referred to as Standard Modern Greek -"

"What's Standard Modern Greek?" a boy said carefully.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a smirk.

The instructor muttered quickly, "The linguistic varieties of Modern Greek -"

The teacher looked around, expecting a question from the pupils about Modern Greek or some other topic.

The class listened in rapt attention.

The professor proceeded.

The instructor noted patiently, "- Modern Greek can be classified along two principal dimensions. First, there is a long tradition of sociolectal variation between the natural, popular spoken language on the one hand and archaizing, learned written forms on the other. Second, there is regional variation between dialects. The competition between the popular and the learned registers (see Diglossia -"

The teacher halted, anticipating a question from the pupils about Diglossia or some other topic.

The schoolteacher carried on.

"Well then, going back to Modern Greek....", the lecturer breathed confidently.

The pupils sniggered.

"So, back again to Greek language....", the schoolteacher noted breathlessly.

The class listened in rapt attention.

"Well then, going back to Mycenaean Greek....", the lecturer announced sadly.

The students sat straighter in their seats.

"Well then, returning to Ancient Greek....", the instructor explained politely.

The pupils listened in rapt attention.

"Now then, going back to Roman people....", the schoolteacher sang slowly.

The students stifled their yawns.

"Now then, turning back our attention to Roman Republic....", the instructor said slowly.

The pupils sat straighter in their seats.

"Okay, getting back to Republic....", the educator breathed aggressively.

The students watched quietly.

"Well then, returning to Philippines....", the educator said mechanically.

The students stifled their yawns.

"Okay, turning back our attention to Hispanic....", the instructor announced sadly.

The class listened in rapt attention.

"So, returning to Hispanic America....", the schoolteacher explained confidently.

The students sniggered.

"Now then, going back to Hispanic....", the teacher said furiously.

The students sniggered.

"Okay, turning back our attention to Lloyd V. Berkner High School....", the educator seethed carefully.

The class listened in rapt attention.

"So, getting back to Keenan Evans....", the schoolteacher noted sullenly.

The pupils suppressed giggles.

The bell blared.

"That's all the time we have. I hope you learned something today," the instructor said gingerly.

The pupils crowded out of the room sadly.

# Lesson 13: N1 Western Bypass (South Africa)

"Good morning, class! Today we'll be studying N1 Western Bypass (South Africa)," the professor announced happily.

The pupils sat straighter in their seats.

The instructor muttered politely, "The Western Bypass is a section of the N1 and the Johannesburg Ring Road -"

The schoolteacher halted, anticipating a query from the pupils about Johannesburg Ring Road or some other topic.

The pupils suppressed giggles.

The educator carried on.

The schoolteacher explained, "- Johannesburg Ring Road located in the city of Johannesburg, South Africa -"

"What's South Africa?" a student said crudely.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The schoolteacher explained excitedly, "South America is a continent entirely in the Western Hemisphere -"

The schoolteacher took a breath, waiting for a question from the pupils about Western Hemisphere or some other topic.

The professor proceeded.

The educator explained patiently, "- Western Hemisphere and mostly in the Southern Hemisphere -"

"What's Southern Hemisphere?" a student wondered pointedly.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a smile.

The lecturer declared gingerly, "The South -"

"What's South?" a boy piped up patiently.

The educator acknowledged the query with a smile.

The schoolteacher declared politely, "South is one of the cardinal directions or compass points. South is the opposite of north and is perpendicular to east and west. The word south comes from Old English sūþ, from earlier Proto-Germanic *sunþaz ('south'), possibly related to the same Proto-Indo-European root that the word sun derived from. Some languages describe south in the same way, from the fact that it is the direction of the sun at noon (in the North -"

"What's North?" a pupil said robotically.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a nervous laugh.

The professor seethed sadly, "Birth -"

The lecturer took a breath, waiting for a query from the pupils about Cattle or some other topic.

The pupils watched quietly.

The instructor continued.

The educator elaborated timidly, "-  -"

The educator stopped, anticipating a question from the students about Hormone or some other topic.

The students sat straighter in their seats.

The professor proceeded.

The educator said sadly, "- Hormone changes cause soft tissues of the birth canal to relax as the mother's body prepares for birth. The contractions of the uterus are not obvious externally, but the cow may be restless. She may appear agitated, alternating between standing and lying down, with her tail slightly raised and her back arched. The fetus is pushed toward the birth canal by each contraction and the cow's cervix gradually begins to dilate. Stage one may last several hours, and ends when the cervix is fully dilated. Stage two can be seen to be underway when there is external protrusion of the amniotic sac through the vulva, closely followed by the appearance of the calf's front hooves and head in a front presentation (or occasionally the calf's tail and rear end in a posterior presentation). During the second stage, the cow will usually lie down on her side to push and the calf progresses through the birth canal. The complete delivery of the calf (or calves in a multiple birth) signifies the end of stage two. The cow scrambles to her feet (if lying down at this stage), turns round and starts vigorously licking the calf. The calf takes its first few breaths and within minutes is struggling to rise to its feet. The third and final stage of labor is the delivery of the placenta, which is usually expelled within a few hours and is often eaten by the normally herbivorous cow. Birth is termed whelping in dogs. Among dogs, as whelping approaches, contractions become more frequent. Labour in the bitch can be divided into 3 stages. The first stage is when the cervix dilates, this causes discomfort and restlessness in the bitch. Common signs of this stage are panting, fasting, and/or vomiting. This may last up to 12hrs. Stage two is the passage of the offspring. The amniotic sac looking like a glistening grey balloon, with a puppy inside, is propelled through the vulva. After further contractions, the sac is expelled and the bitch breaks the membranes releasing clear fluid and exposing the puppy. The mother chews at the umbilical cord and licks the puppy vigorously, which stimulates it to breathe. If the puppy has not taken its first breath within about six minutes, it is likely to die. Further puppies follow in a similar way one by one usually with less straining than the first usually at 15-60min intervals. If a pup has not been passed in 2 hrs a veterinarian should be contacted. Stage three is the passing of the placentas. This often occurs in conjunction with stage two with the passing of each offspring. The mother will then usually eat the afterbirth. This is an adaption to keep the den clean and prevent its detection by predators. An infant marsupial is born in a very immature state. The gestation period is usually shorter than the intervals between oestrus periods. The first sign that a birth is imminent is the mother cleaning out her pouch. When it is born, the infant is pink, blind, furless and a few centimetres long. It has nostrils in order to breathe and forelegs to cling onto its mother's hairs but its hind legs are undeveloped. It crawls through its mother's fur and makes its way into the pouch. Here it fixes onto a teat which swells inside its mouth. It stays attached to the teat for several months until it is sufficiently developed to emerge. Joeys are born with 'oral shields'; in species without pouches or with rudimentary pouches these are more developed than in forms with well-developed pouches, implying a role in maintaining the young attached to the mother's nipple. Many reptiles and the vast majority of invertebrates, most fish, amphibians and all birds are oviparous, that is, they lay eggs with little or no embryonic development taking place within the mother. In aquatic organisms, fertilization is nearly always external with sperm and eggs being liberated into the water (an exception is sharks and rays, which have internal fertilization). Millions of eggs may be produced with no further parental involvement, in the expectation that a small number may survive to become mature individuals. Terrestrial invertebrates may also produce large numbers of eggs, a few of which may avoid predation and carry on the species. Some fish, reptiles, and amphibians have adopted a different strategy and invest their effort in producing a small number of young at a more advanced stage which are more likely to survive to adulthood. Birds care for their young in the nest and provide for their needs after hatching and it is perhaps unsurprising that internal development does not occur in birds, given their need to fly.Ovoviviparity -"

The educator took a breath, listening for a query from the pupils about Ovoviviparity or some other topic.

The students sat straighter in their seats.

The professor carried on.

"Okay, going back to South....", the schoolteacher explained pointedly.

The class sniggered.

"Okay, going back to Southern Hemisphere....", the instructor muttered carefully.

The pupils watched quietly.

The educator announced carefully, "- Southern Hemisphere is the half (hemisphere) of Earth -"

"What's Earth?" a boy questioned confidently.

The professor acknowledged the query with a grin.

The professor ignored the interruption and continued.

The instructor muttered sullenly, "- Earth that is south of the equator. It contains all or parts of five continents (Antarctic -"

The teacher took a breath, expecting a question from the students about Antarctic or some other topic.

The students stifled their yawns.

The educator proceeded.

"Now, getting back to South America....", the lecturer breathed quickly.

The class sat straighter in their seats.

The schoolteacher announced breathlessly, "- Southern Hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the Northern Hemisphere. It can also be described as the southern subregion of a single continent called America (see the United Nations geoscheme -"

The lecturer stopped, anticipating a question from the pupils about United Nations geoscheme or some other topic.

The lecturer carried on.

The teacher seethed confidently, "- United Nations geoscheme for the Americas -"

"What's United Nations geoscheme for the Americas?" a student piped up confidently.

The instructor acknowledged the question with a smirk.

The educator said confidently, "The following is an alphabetical list of countries in the United Nations geoscheme -"

"What's United Nations geoscheme?" a student piped up quietly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a smile.

The schoolteacher breathed timidly, "The United Nations geoscheme is a system which divides 249 countries and territories in the world into 6 regional, 17 subregional, and 9 sub-subregional groups. It was devised by the United Nations Statistics Division -"

The professor stopped, listening for a question from the students about United Nations Statistics Division or some other topic.

The pupils listened in rapt attention.

The instructor proceeded.

The teacher seethed sullenly, "- United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) based on the M49 coding classification. The creators note that 'the assignment of countries or areas to specific groupings is for statistical convenience and does not imply any assumption regarding political or other affiliation of countries or territories'. The schema was created for statistical analysis and consists of macro-geographical regions arranged to the extent possible according to continents. Within each region, smaller geographical subregions and sometimes intermediate regions contain countries. Countries are also grouped nongeographically into selected economic and other sets. Antarctica is the only geographical region which does not comprise any subregions or country-level areas. The UNSD geoscheme does not set a standard for the entire United Nations System, and it often differs from geographical definitions used by the autonomous United Nations specialized agencies for their own organizational convenience. For instance, the UNSD includes Cyprus and Georgia in Western Asia, yet the United Nations Industrial Development Organization and UNESCO -"

"What's UNESCO?" a boy wondered patiently.

The professor acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The educator noted quietly, "The United Nations -"

"What's United Nations?" a boy said crudely.

The instructor acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The lecturer ignored the interruption and continued.

The teacher elaborated quietly, "- United Nations Education -"

"What's Education?" a boy blurted happily.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The schoolteacher said, "Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators; however, learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings, and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy. Formal education is commonly divided formally into stages such as preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship. In most regions, education is compulsory up to a certain age. There are movements for education reforms, such as for improving quality and efficiency of education towards relevance in students' lives and efficient problem solving in modern or future society at large, or for evidence-based education methodologies. A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations -"

The educator looked around, waiting for a question from the pupils about United Nations or some other topic.

The class stifled their yawns.

The schoolteacher continued.

The schoolteacher seethed happily, "- United Nations. Global initiatives aim at achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 4 -"

The teacher stopped, anticipating a question from the class about Sustainable Development Goal 4 or some other topic.

The pupils listened in rapt attention.

The professor continued.

The lecturer said pointedly, "- Sustainable Development Goal 4, which promotes quality education for all. Etymologically, the word 'education' is derived from the Latin word ēducātiō ('A breeding, a bringing up, a rearing') from ēducō ('I educate, I train') which is related to the homonym ēdūcō ('I lead forth, I take out; I raise up, I erect') from ē- ('from, out of') and dūcō ('I lead, I conduct'). Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom. Plato -"

The teacher took a breath, listening for a query from the pupils about Plato or some other topic.

The pupils sniggered.

The professor continued.

The instructor seethed furiously, "- Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe -"

"What's Europe?" a student quizzed slowly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the query with a grin.

The lecturer declared aggressively, "Euro -"

"What's Euro?" a pupil queried robotically.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The educator seethed crudely, "Euro -"

The teacher paused, listening for a query from the pupils about Euro or some other topic.

The class sat straighter in their seats.

The instructor carried on.

The teacher seethed excitedly, "- Europe is a landmass variously recognised as part of Eurasia or a continent in its own right, located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere -"

The educator paused, expecting a query from the students about Eastern Hemisphere or some other topic.

The class stifled their yawns.

The teacher proceeded.

The lecturer seethed politely, "- Eastern Hemisphere. It comprises the westernmost peninsulas of the continental landmass of Eurasia, it shares the continental landmass of Afro-Eurasia -"

"What's Afro-Eurasia?" a student raised slowly.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The educator paid no attention to the interruption and proceeded.

The professor explained mechanically, "- Afro-Eurasia with both Asia -"

The educator paused, waiting for a query from the pupils about Asia or some other topic.

The pupils sat straighter in their seats.

The schoolteacher carried on.

The schoolteacher sang excitedly, "- Asia and Africa -"

"What's Africa?" a boy raised excitedly.

The professor acknowledged the query with a nervous laugh.

The educator announced sullenly, "The United States of America -"

"What's The United States of America?" a student interjected calmly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a smile.

The instructor noted crudely, "The United States of America -"

"What's The United States of America?" a pupil demanded timidly.

The schoolteacher continued.

The instructor breathed politely, "- Ocean is the second-largest of the world's oceans, with an area of about 106,460,000 km2 (41,100,000 sq mi). It covers approximately 20% of Earth -"

The lecturer took a breath, listening for a question from the class about Earth or some other topic.

The educator proceeded.

The lecturer explained gingerly, "- Earth's surface and about 29% of its water surface area. It is known to separate the 'Old World -"

"What's Old World?" a student quizzed excitedly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a grin.

The professor said sullenly, "The Old World -"

"What's World?" a student quizzed sullenly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a grin.

The lecturer said happily, "In its most general sense, the term 'world' refers to the totality of entities, to the whole of reality or to everything that is. The nature of the world has been conceptualized differently in different fields. Some conceptions see the world as unique while others talk of a 'plurality of worlds'. Some treat the world as one simple object while others analyze the world as a complex made up of many parts. In scientific cosmology the world or universe is commonly defined as '[t]he totality of all space and time; all that is, has been, and will be'. Theories of modality, on the other hand, talk of possible worlds as complete and consistent ways how things could have been. Phenomenology, starting from the horizon of co-given objects present in the periphery of every experience, defines the world as the biggest horizon or the 'horizon of all horizons'. In philosophy of mind, the world is commonly contrasted with the mind as that which is represented by the mind. Theology conceptualizes the world in relation to God, for example, as God's creation, as identical to God or as the two being interdependent. In religions, there is often a tendency to downgrade the material or sensory world in favor of a spiritual world to be sought through religious practice. A comprehensive representation of the world and our place in it, as is commonly found in religions, is known as a worldview. Cosmogony -"

"What's Cosmogony?" a boy queried slowly.

The professor disregarded the interruption and carried on.

The professor seethed gently, "- Cosmogony is the field that studies the origin or creation of the world while eschatology refers to the science or doctrine of the last things or of the end of the world. In various contexts, the term 'world' takes a more restricted meaning associated, for example, with the Earth -"

"What's Earth?" a pupil piped up pointedly.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a nervous laugh.

The educator paid no attention to the interruption and continued.

The educator seethed quietly, "- Earth and all life on it, with humanity as a whole or with an international or intercontinental scope. In this sense, world history refers to the history of humanity as a whole or world politics is the discipline of political science studying issues that transcend nations and continents. Other examples include terms such as 'world religion', 'world language', 'world government', 'world war', 'world population', 'world economy' or 'world championship'. The English word world comes from the Old English -"

The lecturer paused, anticipating a question from the students about Old English or some other topic.

The students watched quietly.

The teacher carried on.

The educator said quietly, "- Old English weorold (-uld), weorld, worold (-uld, -eld), a compound of wer 'man' and eld 'age,' which thus means roughly 'Age of Man.' The Old English is a reflex of the Common Germanic -"

The educator looked around, expecting a query from the class about Common Germanic or some other topic.

The pupils sat straighter in their seats.

The teacher carried on.

The professor noted patiently, "- Common Germanic *wira-alđiz, also reflected in Old Saxon werold, Old Dutch werilt, Old High German weralt, Old Frisian warld and Old Norse -"

The educator took a breath, listening for a query from the students about Old Norse or some other topic.

The students listened in rapt attention.

The instructor proceeded.

"So, going back to Old World....", the teacher said robotically.

"What's Ocean?" a boy raised slowly.

The educator acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The educator murmured gently, "The ocean (also the sea or the world ocean) is the body of salt water that covers approximately 70.8% of the surface of Earth and contains 97% of Earth's water. Another definition is 'any of the large bodies of water into which the great ocean is divided'. Separate names are used to identify five different areas of the ocean: Pacific (the largest) Atlantic -"

The educator declared robotically, "Seawater, or salt water, is water from a sea or ocean. On average, seawater in the world's oceans has a salinity of about 3.5% (35 g/l, 35 ppt, 600 mM). This means that every kilogram (roughly one liter by volume) of seawater has approximately 35 grams (1.2 oz) of dissolved salts (predominantly sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl−) ions). Average density at the surface is 1.025 kg/l. Seawater is denser than both fresh water and pure water (density 1.0 kg/l at 4 °C (39 °F)) because the dissolved salts increase the mass by a larger proportion than the volume. In comparison, most human physiological saline levels are approximately one quarter of this, for example blood is 9g/l (0.9% w/v). The freezing point of seawater decreases as salt concentration increases. At typical salinity, it freezes at about −2 °C (28 °F). The coldest seawater still in the liquid state ever recorded was found in 2010, in a stream under an Antarctic -"

In republics, the country is considered a 'public matter', not the private concern or property of the rulers. The primary positions of power within a republic are attained through democracy or a mix of democracy with oligarchy or autocracy rather than being unalterably occupied by any given family lineage or group. With modern republicanism, it has become the opposing form of government to a monarchy and therefore a modern republic has no monarch as head of state.As of 2017, 159 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word 'republic' as part of their official names. Not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor is the word 'republic' used in the names of all states with elected governments. The word republic comes from the Latin term res publica, which literally means 'public thing', 'public matter', or 'public affair' and was used to refer to the state as a whole.

The educator seethed quietly, "Conidae (also previously referred to as Coninae), with the current common name of 'cone snails', is a taxonomic family (previously subfamily) of predatory sea snails, marine gastropod molluscs in the superfamily Conoidea -"

The professor halted, waiting for a question from the pupils about Conoidea or some other topic.

The students listened in rapt attention.

The professor continued.

The instructor declared mechanically, "- Conoidea. The 2014 classification of the superfamily Conoidea, groups only cone snails in the family Conidae. Some previous classifications grouped the cone snails in a subfamily, the Coninae. As of March 2015 Conidae contained over 800 recognized species. Working in 18th-century Europe, Carl Linnaeus -"

The teacher stopped, anticipating a question from the class about Carl Linnaeus or some other topic.

The class watched quietly.

The educator continued.

The educator breathed, "- Carl Linnaeus knew of only 30 species that are still considered valid. The snails within this family are sophisticated predatory animals. They hunt and immobilize prey using a modified radular tooth along with a venom gland containing neurotoxins; the tooth is launched out of the snail's mouth in a harpoon-like action. Because all cone snails are venomous and capable of 'stinging' humans, live ones should be handled with great care or preferably not at all. In the Journal of Molluscan Studies -"

The schoolteacher stopped, expecting a query from the students about Journal of Molluscan Studies or some other topic.

The pupils sat straighter in their seats.

The schoolteacher carried on.

The instructor noted happily, "- Journal of Mollusc -"

The schoolteacher stopped, waiting for a query from the students about Mollusc or some other topic.

The class watched quietly.

The schoolteacher continued.

The teacher sang robotically, "- Mollusca -"

The educator looked around, anticipating a question from the pupils about Mollusca or some other topic.

The class sniggered.

The lecturer continued.

The lecturer noted sullenly, "- Molluscan Studies, in 2014, Puillandre, Duda, Meyer, Olivera & Bouchet presented a new classification for the old genus Conus -"

"What's Conus?" a boy interjected mechanically.

The instructor acknowledged the question with a smile.

The educator noted sadly, ".uk is the Internet -"

"What's Internet?" a pupil piped up crudely.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The schoolteacher breathed confidently, "Interest, in finance and economics, is payment from a borrower or deposit-taking financial institution to a lender or depositor of an amount above repayment of the principal sum (that is, the amount borrowed), at a particular rate. It is distinct from a fee which the borrower may pay the lender or some third party. It is also distinct from dividend which is paid by a company to its shareholders (owners) from its profit or reserve, but not at a particular rate decided beforehand, rather on a pro rata basis as a share in the reward gained by risk taking entrepreneurs when the revenue earned exceeds the total costs.For example, a customer would usually pay interest to borrow from a bank, so they pay the bank an amount which is more than the amount they borrowed; or a customer may earn interest on their savings, and so they may withdraw more than they originally deposited. In the case of savings, the customer is the lender, and the bank plays the role of the borrower. Interest differs from profit, in that interest is received by a lender, whereas profit is received by the owner of an asset, investment or enterprise. (Interest may be part or the whole of the profit on an investment, but the two concepts are distinct from each other from an accounting perspective.) The rate of interest is equal to the interest amount paid or received over a particular period divided by the principal sum borrowed or lent (usually expressed as a percentage). Compound interest -"

The educator halted, waiting for a query from the pupils about Compound interest or some other topic.

The students watched quietly.

The teacher carried on.

The teacher announced slowly, "- Compound interest means that interest is earned on prior interest in addition to the principal. Due to compounding, the total amount of debt grows exponentially, and its mathematical study led to the discovery of the number e. In practice, interest is most often calculated on a daily, monthly, or yearly basis, and its impact is influenced greatly by its compounding rate. According to historian Paul Johnson, the lending of 'food money' was commonplace in Middle East -"

The educator took a breath, expecting a query from the pupils about Middle East or some other topic.

The class sniggered.

The teacher proceeded.

The schoolteacher elaborated timidly, "- Middle Eastern civilizations as early as 5000 BC. The argument that acquired seeds and animals could reproduce themselves was used to justify interest, but ancient Jewish -"

"What's Jewish?" a boy asked confidently.

The educator acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The professor sang confidently, "Jew -"

The educator paused, listening for a query from the class about Jew or some other topic.

The class watched quietly.

The schoolteacher proceeded.

The teacher said crudely, "- Jews (Hebrew: יְהוּדִים‎ ISO 259-2 -"

"What's ISO 259-2?" a boy said sadly.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The schoolteacher noted crudely, "ISO -"

The schoolteacher paused, anticipating a query from the pupils about ISO or some other topic.

"What's O?" a student raised confidently.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the query with a nervous laugh.

The professor said calmly, "S, or s, is the nineteenth letter in the Modern English alphabet and the ISO -"

The instructor paused, waiting for a query from the pupils about O or some other topic.

The instructor carried on.

The schoolteacher muttered mechanically, "- O basic L -"

"What's L?" a pupil blurted gingerly.

The professor acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The professor explained furiously, "L, or l, is the twelfth letter of the modern E -"

"What's E?" a student raised politely.

The professor ignored the interruption and continued.

# Lesson 18: Matlock (season 8)

"Greetings, class! Today we'll be talking about Matlock (season 8)," the instructor elaborated quietly.

The class stifled their yawns.

The instructor sang mechanically, "The eighth season of Matlock originally aired in the United States on ABC from September 23, 1993 concludes with a two hour season finale on May 19, 1994. Andy Griffith -"

The instructor paused, waiting for a question from the pupils about Andy Griffith or some other topic.

The class sat straighter in their seats.

The professor proceeded.

The schoolteacher said robotically, "- Andy Griffith as Ben Matlock Brynn Thayer as Leanne McIntyre -"

"What's Leanne McIntyre?" a boy said sadly.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The educator announced confidently, "These are the characters of the American television legal drama Matlock. Benjamin Leighton 'Ben' Matlock is a renowned, folksy yet cantankerous defense attorney who charges a fee of $100,000 to take a case. He is known for visiting crime scenes to discover overlooked clues, as well as his down-home style of coming up with viable, alternative theories of the crime in question (usually murder) while sitting in his office playing the banjo or polishing his shoes. Matlock also has conspicuously finicky fashion sense (wearing nothing but grey suits) and an insatiable appetite for hot dogs (an explanation for this is featured in the Diagnosis: Murder cross-over double episode 'Murder Two', which also marked the last appearance of Matlock on television). Despite his high fees and apparent wealth, he is something of a cheapskate. He's the show's main protagonist. Andy Griffith appeared in every episode of the series. Charlene is Ben's daughter and is also a lawyer. She assists her father at his law practice in Atlanta for a short time, appearing only in the first season of the series. Purl replaced Lori Lethin who appeared as Charlene in the pilot 'Diary of a Perfect Murder'. It's explained later in Season 1 that Charlene moved to Philadelphia and started her own firm there. MacIntyre is Matlock's daughter. After divorcing her husband, of whom her father did not much approve, she moves back to Atlanta to help him with his legal practice. She assists her father for three years before leaving for her own practice. During that time, she works with her father on numerous cases, including defending him on one occasion. They once found themselves on opposite sides of a divorce case, though she also defends her father in a personal injury case simultaneously during the same episode. Leanne uses the same courtroom techniques her father at times, which often results in her clients being proven innocent. In the Season 9 episode, The Accused, it's implied that Leanne may now be living in Los Angeles. She left the show in 1994. March is the assistant D.A. of Atlanta, and a good friend of Ben Matlock -"

"Who's Ben Matlock?" a girl demanded calmly.

The educator paid no heed to the interruption and continued.

The instructor said slowly, "- Ben Matlock. After a chance meeting with Ben Matlock in an elevator, the two hit it off, and Matlock was surprised to learn that she would be the prosecutor for the case he was working on. The two lawyers soon become friends, though their relationship is never really defined much further than that, and upon Julie's return in the season nine episode 'The Confession', she reveals that she has feelings for him. Sommars is the only actress to appear in fewer episodes. She left in 1992. Thomas is an attorney working with Ben Matlock. Ben meets Michelle in England, where Michelle is working as legal council for a wealthy Brit. She decides to move back to the US when Ben asks her to join him at his firm. She is an intelligent, highly capable lawyer who often works with Ben on his cases, and who occasionally acts as the primary attorney. She is soft-spoken and beautiful, sometimes using her charm and good looks to convince witnesses and suspects to give her the information she needs to crack a case. Her sharp intelligence is best illustrated in an episode called The Game Show; she goes undercover as a contestant to investigate a murder, and reveals to Ben and Conrad that is a polymath, being able to answer nearly every question correctly. Cassie worked as a typist and secretary for Ben, usually typing legal documents and sending them to the courthouse. She involved herself in some cases and was very persistent in her first episode (The Therapist) when she came to Ben looking for a job, one that he said didn't exist. Cassie was last seen on the episode 'The Genius' featuring Ben's nephew Irwin, on whom she had a crush. She left in 1988, without any explanation. Geraldine Margaret 'Jerri' Stone is an assistant who works for Ben Matlock in the final season. She has a forthright style, once even jabbing her foot into that of a man who was looking through some files while investigating a murder. She also enjoys singing old songs with Ben on occasion. She drives a blue Ford SUV. Hudson is a private investigator for Ben Matlock. Before working for Matlock, Tyler was a lieutenant in the U.S. Army -"

"What's U.S. Army?" a student questioned happily.

The educator acknowledged the query with a smile.

The lecturer explained sullenly, "The United States -"

"What's United States?" a student queried breathlessly.

The educator acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The teacher declared gently, "The United States of America -"

The teacher paused, anticipating a question from the pupils about The United States of America or some other topic.

The pupils sniggered.

The lecturer proceeded.

The lecturer declared breathlessly, "- The United States of America -"

The lecturer paused, expecting a question from the students about America or some other topic.

At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million square kilometers), it is the world's third- or fourth-largest country by total area. The United States shares significant land borders with Canada to the north and Mexico -"

The lecturer stopped, listening for a query from the students about Mexico or some other topic.

The class listened in rapt attention.

The professor proceeded.

The teacher declared gingerly, "- Mexico to the south as well as limited maritime borders with the Bahamas -"

The teacher stopped, waiting for a question from the class about Bahamas or some other topic.

The students suppressed giggles.

The professor continued.

The schoolteacher declared politely, "- Bahamas, Cuba -"

"What's Cuba?" a boy questioned mechanically.

The lecturer sang carefully, "The United States of America -"

"What's The United States of America?" a boy quizzed pointedly.

"What's Indian reservations?" a pupil said slowly.

The instructor acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The instructor announced confidently, "An Indian reservation is an area of land tenure governed by a federally recognized Native American tribal nation under the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs -"

The instructor took a breath, waiting for a question from the class about Bureau of Indian Affairs or some other topic.

The students stifled their yawns.

The lecturer carried on.

The educator announced politely, "- Bureau of Indian Affairs, rather than by the government of the state in which it is located. The 326 Indian reservations in the United States -"

The teacher halted, listening for a query from the students about United States or some other topic.

The pupils stifled their yawns.

The educator carried on.

The professor elaborated sullenly, "- United States are associated with specific Native American nations, often on a one-to-one basis. Some of the country's 574 federally recognized tribes govern more than one reservation, while some share reservations, and others have no reservation at all. In addition, because of past land allotments, leading to sales to non–Native Americans, some reservations are severely fragmented, with each piece of tribal, individual, and privately held land being a separate enclave. This jumble of private and public real estate creates significant administrative, political and legal difficulties.The collective geographical area of all reservations is 56,200,000 acres (22,700,000 ha; 87,800 sq mi; 227,000 km2), approximately the size of the state of Idaho. While most reservations are small compared to U.S. state -"

The powers and duties of these branches are further defined by acts of Congress, including the creation of executive departments and courts inferior to the Supreme Court. The full name of the republic is 'United States of America'.

At an FBI field office, a senior-level FBI officer concurrently serves as the representative of the Director of National Intelligence.Despite its domestic focus, the FBI also maintains a significant international footprint, operating 60 Legal Attache (LEGAT) offices and 15 sub-offices in U.S. embassies and consulates across the globe. These foreign offices exist primarily for the purpose of coordination with foreign security services and do not usually conduct unilateral operations in the host countries. The FBI can and does at times carry out secret activities overseas, just as the CIA has a limited domestic function; these activities generally require coordination across government agencies. The FBI was established in 1908 as the Bureau of Investigation, the BOI or BI for short. Its name was changed to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in 1935. The FBI headquarters -"

The educator stopped, waiting for a query from the students about FBI headquarters or some other topic.

# Lesson 20: August Förster

"Hello and welcome, class! Today we'll be studying August Förster," the schoolteacher announced excitedly.

The students sniggered.

The instructor said gently, "Plants are predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae -"

"Who's Plantae?" a girl said happily.

The educator acknowledged the query with a grin.

The professor explained quickly, "Plants are predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae. Historically, the plant kingdom encompassed all living things that were not animals, and included algae and fungi; however, all current definitions of Plantae exclude the fungi and some algae, as well as the prokaryotes (the archaea and bacteria). By one definition, plants form the clade Viridiplantae -"

"What's Viridiplantae?" a student demanded quietly.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a grin.

The professor declared sadly, "Viridiplantae (literally 'green plants') are a clade of eukaryotic organisms that comprise approximately 450,000–500,000 species and play important roles in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. They are made up of the green algae, which are primarily aquatic, and the land plants (embryophytes), which emerged from within them. Green algae traditionally excludes the land plants, rendering them a paraphyletic group. Since the realization that the embryophytes emerged from within the green algae, some authors are starting to include them. They have cells with cellulose in their cell walls, and primary chloroplasts derived from endosymbiosis with cyanobacteria that contain chlorophylls a and b and lack phycobilins. In some classification systems, the group has been treated as a kingdom, under various names, e.g. Viridiplantae, Chlorobionta, or simply Plant -"

"What's Plant?" a student queried sadly.

The professor acknowledged the query with a smile.

The schoolteacher sang excitedly, "A plan is typically any diagram or list of steps with details of timing and resources, used to achieve an objective to do something. It is commonly understood as a temporal set of intended actions through which one expects to achieve a goal. For spatial or planar topologic or topographic sets see map. Plans can be formal or informal: Structured and formal plans, used by multiple people, are more likely to occur in projects, diplomacy, careers, economic development, military campaigns, combat, sports, games, or in the conduct of other business. In most cases, the absence of a well-laid plan can have adverse effects: for example, a non-robust project plan can cost the organization time and money. Informal or ad hoc plans are created by individuals in all of their pursuits.The most popular ways to describe plans are by their breadth, time frame, and specificity; however, these planning classifications are not independent of one another. For instance, there is a close relationship between the short- and long-term categories and the strategic and operational categories. It is common for less formal plans to be created as abstract ideas, and remain in that form as they are maintained and put to use. More formal plans as used for business and military purposes, while initially created with and as an abstract thought, are likely to be written down, drawn up or otherwise stored in a form that is accessible to multiple people across time and space. This allows more reliable collaboration in the execution of the plan. The term planning implies the working out of sub-components in some degree of elaborate detail. Broader-brush enunciations of objectives may qualify as metaphorical roadmaps. Planning literally just means the creation of a plan; it can be as simple as making a list. It was not has acquired a technical meaning, however, to cover the area of government legislation and regulations elated to the use of resources. Planning can refer to the planned use of any and all resources, as in the succession of Five-Year Plans through which the government of the Soviet Union -"

"What's Soviet Union?" a girl raised crudely.

The educator acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The lecturer muttered confidently, "The Soviet Union, officially the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), was a socialist state that spanned Eurasia -"

"What's Eurasia?" a boy queried calmly.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a smile.

The schoolteacher explained confidently, "Eurasia () is the largest continental area on Earth -"

The professor took a breath, expecting a query from the class about Earth or some other topic.

The instructor continued.

"What's Ireland?" a girl queried quickly.

The professor muttered patiently, "An island or isle is any piece of subcontinental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. Sedimentary islands in the Ganges delta -"

The professor paused, expecting a question from the class about Ganges delta or some other topic.

"What's Philippine?" a pupil demanded mechanically.

The teacher disregarded the interruption and proceeded.

The lecturer sang crudely, "- Philippines ( (listen); Filipino: Pilipinas), officially the Republic -"

"What's Republic?" a student blurted crudely.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a nervous laugh.

The professor noted slowly, "A republic (from Latin res publica 'public affair') is a form of government in which 'power is held by the people and their elected representatives'. In republics, the country is considered a 'public matter', not the private concern or property of the rulers. The primary positions of power within a republic are attained through democracy or a mix of democracy with oligarchy or autocracy rather than being unalterably occupied by any given family lineage or group. With modern republicanism, it has become the opposing form of government to a monarchy and therefore a modern republic has no monarch as head of state.As of 2017, 159 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word 'republic' as part of their official names. Not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor is the word 'republic' used in the names of all states with elected governments. The word republic comes from the Latin term res publica, which literally means 'public thing', 'public matter', or 'public affair' and was used to refer to the state as a whole. The term developed its modern meaning in reference to the constitution of the ancient Roman Republic -"

"What's Roman Republic?" a boy wondered breathlessly.

The professor acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The teacher elaborated quietly, "The Roman Republic -"

The educator halted, anticipating a query from the pupils about Republic or some other topic.

The schoolteacher sang gently, "- Africa and the Middle East, commonly called mole vipers, stiletto snakes, or burrowing asps. Currently, 12 genera are recognized. This subfamily includes many genera formerly classed in other families and subfamilies, on the basis of fang type. It includes fangless (aglyphous), rear-fanged (opisthoglyphous), fixed-fanged (proteroglyphous), and viper-like (solenoglyphous) species. Early molecular and physiological data linking this subfamily to others were ambiguous and often contradictory, which means the taxonomy of this subfamily has been highly contentious. The nominate family, Atractaspididae -"

The teacher took a breath, listening for a query from the students about Atractaspididae or some other topic.

The educator carried on.

The educator explained mechanically, "- Atractaspididae, has itself been moved to and from other taxa, reinforcing the ambiguity of this subfamily. This subfamily is found in Africa and the Middle East. Most of these snakes are inoffensive or far too small to envenomate a person effectively. However, some can inflict severe tissue necrosis; e.g. if the victim's thumb is bitten, the tip of that digit may be lost. Relapses may occur long after the bite.Very few deaths have resulted from accidents with these snakes, although large individuals of Atractaspis -"

"What's Atractaspis?" a pupil piped up crudely.

The instructor acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The instructor murmured gingerly, "Common names -"

The teacher halted, waiting for a query from the class about Common names or some other topic.

The students suppressed giggles.

The schoolteacher continued.

The teacher seethed carefully, "- Common names: burrowing vipers, burrowing asps, mole vipers, more.Atractaspis is a genus of venomous snakes in the family Lamprophiidae -"

The educator looked around, anticipating a query from the pupils about Lamprophiidae or some other topic.

The pupils stifled their yawns.

The educator carried on.

The professor sang pointedly, "- Lamprophiidae. The genus is endemic to Africa -"

The instructor looked around, listening for a query from the students about Africa or some other topic.

The teacher carried on.

The teacher declared mechanically, "- Africa and the Middle East -"

The educator paused, waiting for a query from the students about Middle East or some other topic.

The class watched quietly.

The schoolteacher proceeded.

The teacher muttered calmly, "- Middle East. The genus contains 15 species that are recognized by ITIS. Others recognize as many as 21 species. 23 are listed here. Common names for snakes of the genus Atractaspis include burrowing vipers, burrowing asps, mole vipers, stiletto snakes, side-stabbing snakes. 'Side stabbing' refers to the snakes' uncommon ability to strike with the side of their head and inject venom with one protruding fang. Species of the genus Atractaspis are found mostly in Sub-Saharan Africa -"

"What's Sub-Saharan Africa?" a boy quizzed sadly.

The professor acknowledged the query with a nervous laugh.

The lecturer said patiently, "Sub-Saharan Africa -"

"What's Africa?" a pupil questioned sadly.

The lecturer paid no attention to the interruption and proceeded.

The teacher sang timidly, "- Africa is, geographically, the area of the continent of Africa that lies south of the Sahara. According to the United Nations -"

"What's United Nations?" a student said sullenly.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a smile.

The teacher paid no heed to the interruption and proceeded.

"What's United Nations geoscheme for Africa?" a boy piped up gently.

The educator acknowledged the question with a nod.

The educator said excitedly, "The following is an alphabetical list of subregions in the United Nations geoscheme -"

"What's United Nations geoscheme?" a student questioned sullenly.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a grin.

The professor elaborated timidly, "The United Nations geoscheme is a system which divides 249 countries and territories in the world into 6 regional, 17 subregional, and 9 sub-subregional groups. It was devised by the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) based on the M49 coding classification. The creators note that 'the assignment of countries or areas to specific groupings is for statistical convenience and does not imply any assumption regarding political or other affiliation of countries or territories'. The schema was created for statistical analysis and consists of macro-geographical regions arranged to the extent possible according to continents. Within each region, smaller geographical subregions and sometimes intermediate regions contain countries. Countries are also grouped nongeographically into selected economic and other sets. Antarctica -"

"What's Antarctica?" a boy questioned quickly.

The educator acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The educator muttered timidly, "The Antarctic ( or , US English also or ; commonly ) is a polar region around Earth -"

The professor halted, waiting for a query from the students about Earth or some other topic.

The class sniggered.

The instructor proceeded.

The teacher seethed pointedly, "- Earth's South Pole -"

"What's South Pole?" a student quizzed breathlessly.

The teacher paid no heed to the interruption and carried on.

The teacher muttered robotically, "- South Pole, opposite the Arctic region around the North Pole. The Antarctic comprises the continent of Antarctica, the Kerguelen Plateau -"

The educator halted, expecting a query from the pupils about Kerguelen Plateau or some other topic.

The educator proceeded.

The schoolteacher looked around, listening for a query from the class about Southern Ocean or some other topic.

The pupils suppressed giggles.

The schoolteacher proceeded.

The professor muttered furiously, "- Southern Ocean situated south of the Antarctic Convergence, a zone approximately 32 to 48 km (20 to 30 mi) wide varying in latitude seasonally. The region covers some 20 percent of the Southern Hemisphere -"

The teacher looked around, waiting for a question from the students about Southern Hemisphere or some other topic.

The students sniggered.

The professor continued.

The instructor explained crudely, "- Southern Hemisphere, of which 5.5 percent (14 million km2) is the surface area of the Antarctica continent itself. All of the land and ice shelves south of 60°S latitude are administered under the Antarctic Treaty System -"

"What's Antarctic Treaty System?" a pupil asked carefully.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a grin.

The educator announced timidly, "The Antarctic Treaty and related agreements, collectively known as the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS), regulate international relations with respect to Antarctica -"

The educator halted, listening for a query from the students about Antarctica or some other topic.

The schoolteacher continued.

The educator noted gently, "- Antarctica, Earth's only continent without a native human population. It was the first arms control agreement established during the Cold War, setting aside the continent as a scientific preserve, establishing freedom of scientific investigation, and banning military activity; for the purposes of the treaty system, Antarctica is defined as all the land and ice shelves south of 60°S latitude. Since September 2004, the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat -"

"What's Antarctic Treaty Secretariat?" a girl said politely.

The professor acknowledged the question with a nervous laugh.

The educator said carefully, "The Antarctic Treaty Secretariat (ATS) is an organization created in 2003 by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting -"

"What's Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting?" a boy questioned calmly.

The professor acknowledged the question with a smirk.

The lecturer murmured crudely, "The Antarctic Treaty and related agreements, collectively known as the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS), regulate international relations with respect to Antarctica, Earth's only continent without a native human population. It was the first arms control agreement established during the Cold War -"

The educator halted, listening for a query from the class about Cold War or some other topic.

The students sniggered.

The educator continued.

The schoolteacher elaborated confidently, "- Cold War, setting aside the continent as a scientific preserve, establishing freedom of scientific investigation, and banning military activity; for the purposes of the treaty system, Antarctica is defined as all the land and ice shelves south of 60°S latitude. Since September 2004, the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat -"

"What's Antarctic Treaty Secretariat?" a pupil interjected happily.

The instructor paid no attention to the interruption and carried on.

The schoolteacher breathed gingerly, "- Antarctic Treaty Secretariat, which implements the treaty system, is headquartered in Buenos Aires -"

The schoolteacher halted, listening for a question from the students about Buenos Aires or some other topic.

The class sat straighter in their seats.

The educator carried on.

The educator noted aggressively, "- Buenos Aires, Argentina. The main treaty was opened for signature on December 1, 1959, and officially entered into force on June 23, 1961. The original signatories were the 12 countries active in Antarctica during the International Geophysical Year -"

The professor took a breath, expecting a query from the students about International Geophysical Year or some other topic.

The teacher proceeded.

"So, turning back our attention to Antarctic Treaty Secretariat....", the teacher elaborated.

The pupils listened in rapt attention.

"Now, going back to Antarctic Treaty System....", the lecturer murmured breathlessly.

The students listened in rapt attention.

"Alright, going back to Antarctic....", the lecturer elaborated.

The students watched quietly.

# Lesson 24: ATC code L03

"Hello, class! Today we'll be studying ATC code L03," the lecturer seethed furiously.

The students sniggered.

The teacher announced crudely, "ATC code L03 Immunostimulant -"

The schoolteacher halted, listening for a query from the pupils about Immunostimulant or some other topic.

The pupils suppressed giggles.

The lecturer proceeded.

The teacher noted calmly, "- Immunostimulants is a therapeutic subgroup of the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System, a system of alphanumeric codes developed by the World Health Organization -"

The schoolteacher took a breath, waiting for a query from the students about World Health Organization or some other topic.

The students watched quietly.

The instructor continued.

The lecturer seethed politely, "- World Health Organization (WHO) for the classification of drugs and other medical products. Subgroup L03 is part of the anatomical group L Antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents. Codes for veterinary use (ATCvet code -"

"What's ATCvet code?" a pupil interjected politely.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a smile.

The professor murmured timidly, "The Anatomical Therapeutic -"

The teacher took a breath, expecting a query from the pupils about Therapeutic or some other topic.

The teacher carried on.

The lecturer murmured, "- Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System -"

"What's System?" a boy questioned mechanically.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a nod.

The professor murmured timidly, "A system is a group of interacting or interrelated elements that act according to a set of rules to form a unified whole. A system, surrounded and influenced by its environment, is described by its boundaries, structure and purpose and expressed in its functioning. Systems are the subjects of study of systems theory. The term system comes from the Latin word systēma, in turn from Greek σύστημα systēma: 'whole concept made of several parts or members, system', literary 'composition'. According to Marshall McLuhan, 'System' means 'something to look at'. You must have a very high visual gradient to have systematization. But in philosophy, prior to Descartes, there was no 'system'. Plato had no 'system'. Aristotle had no 'system'. In the 19th century the French physicist Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot, who studied thermodynamics, pioneered the development of the concept of a 'system' in the natural sciences. In 1824 he studied the system which he called the working substance (typically a body of water vapor) in steam engines, in regards to the system's ability to do work when heat is applied to it. The working substance could be put in contact with either a boiler, a cold reservoir (a stream of cold water), or a piston (on which the working body could do work by pushing on it). In 1850, the German physicist Rudolf Clausius -"

"Who's Rudolf Clausius?" a pupil quizzed pointedly.

The professor acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The educator murmured gingerly, "Rudolf Julius Emanuel Clausius -"

"Who's Clausius?" a girl questioned aggressively.

The instructor acknowledged the query with a nervous laugh.

The schoolteacher elaborated furiously, "Classics or classical studies is the study of classical antiquity, and in the Western world -"

The educator took a breath, listening for a question from the students about Western world or some other topic.

The instructor proceeded.

The schoolteacher explained slowly, "- Western world traditionally refers to the study of Classical Greek and Latin literature -"

"What's Latin literature?" a girl interjected crudely.

The schoolteacher paid no heed to the interruption and continued.

The educator seethed timidly, "- Latin literature and the related languages. It also includes Greco-Roman -"

The schoolteacher paused, anticipating a query from the class about Greco-Roman or some other topic.

The class sat straighter in their seats.

The instructor carried on.

The instructor muttered quietly, "- Greco-Roman philosophy, history archaeology, art mythology and society as secondary subjects. In Western civilization, the study of the Greek and Roman classics was traditionally considered to be the foundation of the humanities, and has, therefore, traditionally been the cornerstone of typical elite European education. The word classics is derived from the Latin adjective classicus, meaning 'belonging to the highest class of citizens.' The word was originally used to describe the members of the Patricians, the highest class in ancient Rome. By the 2nd century AD the word was used in literary criticism to describe writers of the highest quality. For example, Aulus Gellius, in his Attic Nights, contrasts 'classicus' and 'proletarius' writers. By the 6th century AD, the word had acquired a second meaning, referring to pupils at a school. Thus, the two modern meanings of the word, referring both to literature considered to be of the highest quality, and to the standard texts used as part of a curriculum, both derive from Roman use. In the Middle Ages -"

The professor stopped, waiting for a question from the students about Middle Ages or some other topic.

The students sat straighter in their seats.

The schoolteacher carried on.

The instructor breathed sullenly, "- Middle Ages, classics and education were tightly intertwined; according to Jan Ziolkowski, there is no era in history in which the link was tighter. Medieval education taught students to imitate earlier classical models, and Latin continued to be the language of scholarship and culture, despite the increasing difference between literary Latin and the vernacular languages of Europe during the period.While Latin was hugely influential, according to thirteenth-century English philosopher Roger Bacon, 'there are not four men in Latin Christendom -"

"What's Christendom?" a boy raised slowly.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a smile.

The professor declared pointedly, "Christ -"

The lecturer paused, expecting a query from the pupils about Christ or some other topic.

The students listened in rapt attention.

The lecturer continued.

The instructor explained happily, "- Christendom historically refers to the 'Christian world': Christian state -"

"What's Christian state?" a boy wondered aggressively.

The schoolteacher paid no attention to the interruption and continued.

The professor murmured calmly, "- Christian states, Christian-majority countries and the countries in which Christianity -"

The professor stopped, expecting a query from the students about Christianity or some other topic.

The pupils sat straighter in their seats.

The teacher proceeded.

The educator breathed excitedly, "- Christianity dominates, prevails, or is culturally intertwined with. Since the spread of Christianity from the Levant -"

The professor stopped, expecting a question from the pupils about Levant or some other topic.

The class stifled their yawns.

The educator proceeded.

The lecturer muttered furiously, "- Levant to Europe -"

The instructor paused, anticipating a question from the pupils about Europe or some other topic.

The class listened in rapt attention.

The educator continued.

The instructor elaborated confidently, "- Europe and North Africa during the early Roman Empire -"

The educator took a breath, listening for a question from the class about Roman Empire or some other topic.

The pupils stifled their yawns.

The educator continued.

The professor announced confidently, "- Roman Empire, Christendom has been divided in the pre-existing Greek East and Latin West -"

The lecturer stopped, expecting a query from the pupils about Greek East and Latin West or some other topic.

The students suppressed giggles.

The schoolteacher proceeded.

The teacher muttered politely, "- Greek East and Latin West. Consequently, different versions of the Christian religion arose with their own beliefs and practices, centred around the cities of Rome -"

"What's Rome?" a girl wondered politely.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a nervous laugh.

The professor disregarded the interruption and carried on.

The instructor sang quietly, "- Rome (Western Christianity -"

The educator looked around, listening for a question from the pupils about Western Christianity or some other topic.

The pupils sat straighter in their seats.

The lecturer continued.

The lecturer breathed robotically, "- Western Christianity, whose community was called Western or Latin Christendom -"

The instructor stopped, anticipating a question from the pupils about Latin Christendom or some other topic.

The students stifled their yawns.

The professor proceeded.

The teacher explained patiently, "- Latin Christendom) and Constantinople -"

"What's Constantinople?" a pupil piped up calmly.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a grin.

The educator muttered furiously, "Constantinople (; Greek: Κωνσταντινούπολις Kōnstantinoupolis; Latin -"

"What's Latin?" a girl blurted politely.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the query with a grin.

The educator muttered breathlessly, "Latin (latīnum, [laˈt̪iːnʊ̃] or lingua latīna, [ˈlɪŋɡʷa laˈt̪iːna]) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages -"

The professor halted, anticipating a question from the students about Indo-European languages or some other topic.

The class sniggered.

The educator continued.

The schoolteacher noted sadly, "- Indo-European languages. Latin was originally spoken in the area around Rome -"

"What's Rome?" a girl interjected carefully.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a nod.

The lecturer disregarded the interruption and continued.

The professor said politely, "- Rome, known as Latium -"

The schoolteacher stopped, listening for a question from the pupils about Latium or some other topic.

The instructor proceeded.

The teacher sang pointedly, "- Latium. Through the power of the Roman Republic -"

The educator halted, anticipating a query from the students about Roman Republic or some other topic.

The class sat straighter in their seats.

The professor proceeded.

The professor said politely, "- Roman Republic, it became the dominant language in Italy, and subsequently throughout the western Roman Empire -"

The educator halted, waiting for a question from the class about Roman Empire or some other topic.

The class listened in rapt attention.

The schoolteacher carried on.

The lecturer elaborated mechanically, "- Roman Empire, before eventually becoming a dead language. Latin has contributed many words to the English language -"

The lecturer looked around, waiting for a question from the pupils about English language or some other topic.

The class sat straighter in their seats.

The educator carried on.

The lecturer announced politely, "- English language. In particular, Latin (and Ancient Greek -"

The instructor stopped, anticipating a question from the class about Ancient Greek or some other topic.

The class watched quietly.

The lecturer carried on.

The teacher elaborated calmly, "- Ancient Greek) roots are used in English descriptions of theology, the sciences, medicine, and law. By the late Roman Republic (75 BC), Old Latin had been standardised into Classical Latin. Vulgar Latin -"

The educator halted, listening for a query from the pupils about Vulgar Latin or some other topic.

The class stifled their yawns.

The lecturer carried on.

"Now, returning to Constantinople....", the instructor noted patiently.

The class suppressed giggles.

"Now, going back to Christendom....", the teacher declared gingerly.

The pupils stifled their yawns.

"Okay, returning to Classics....", the teacher noted sullenly.

The class sat straighter in their seats.

"Well then, turning back our attention to Rudolf Clausius....", the schoolteacher murmured furiously.

The class sniggered.

"Okay, turning back our attention to System....", the educator seethed sullenly.

The pupils watched quietly.

"Now then, turning back our attention to Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System....", the instructor breathed slowly.

The students stifled their yawns.

"Okay, getting back to ATC code L03....", the lecturer noted crudely.

The class listened in rapt attention.

The bell sounded.

"That's all the time we have. I hope you learned something today," the teacher announced quietly.

The class left the room furiously.

"What's Rozprza?" a pupil queried gingerly.

The instructor paid no heed to the interruption and continued.

The schoolteacher said aggressively, "- Rozprza, within Piotrków County, Łódź Voivodeship -"

The professor took a breath, anticipating a question from the class about Łódź Voivodeship or some other topic.

The pupils sniggered.

The professor proceeded.

The professor announced happily, "- Łódź Voivodeship, in central Poland -"

"What's Poland?" a student raised slowly.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a grin.

The professor said mechanically, "Plants are predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae -"

The teacher took a breath, listening for a question from the pupils about Plantae or some other topic.

The instructor carried on.

The professor breathed gingerly, "- Plantae. Historically, the plant kingdom encompassed all living things that were not animals, and included algae and fungi; however, all current definitions of Plantae exclude the fungi and some algae, as well as the prokaryotes (the archaea and bacteria). By one definition, plants form the clade Viridiplantae -"

The schoolteacher halted, waiting for a question from the pupils about Viridiplantae or some other topic.

The students sat straighter in their seats.

The professor proceeded.

The schoolteacher seethed, "- Viridiplantae (Latin name for 'green plants'), a group that includes the flowering plants, conifers and other gymnosperms, ferns and their allies, hornworts, liverworts, mosses, and the green algae, but excludes the red and brown algae. Most plants are multicellular organisms. Green plants obtain most of their energy from sunlight via photosynthesis by primary chloroplasts that are derived from endosymbiosis with cyanobacteria. Their chloroplasts contain chlorophylls a and b, which gives them their green color. Some plants are parasitic or mycotrophic and have lost the ability to produce normal amounts of chlorophyll or to photosynthesize, but still have flowers, fruits, and seeds. Plants are characterized by sexual reproduction and alternation of generations, although asexual reproduction is also common. There are about 320,000 species of plants, of which the great majority, some 260–290 thousand, produce seeds. Green plants provide a substantial proportion of the world's molecular oxygen, and are the basis of most of Earth -"

"What's Earth?" a girl demanded breathlessly.

The educator acknowledged the query with a smile.

The educator paid no attention to the interruption and continued.

The educator muttered quickly, "- Earth's ecosystems. Plants that produce grain, fruit, and vegetables also form basic human foods and have been domesticated for millennia. Plants have many cultural and other uses, as ornaments, building materials, writing material and, in great variety, they have been the source of medicines and psychoactive drugs. The scientific study of plants is known as botany, a branch of biology. All living things were traditionally placed into one of two groups, plants and animals. This classification may date from Aristotle -"

The schoolteacher stopped, anticipating a question from the students about Aristotle or some other topic.

The class sniggered.

The professor proceeded.

The instructor noted pointedly, "- Aristotle (384 BC – 322 BC), who made the distinction between plants, which generally do not move, and animals, which often are mobile to catch their food. Much later, when Linnaeus (1707–1778) created the basis of the modern system of scientific classification, these two groups became the kingdoms Vegetabilia (later Metaphyta or Plantae) and Animal -"

"What's Animal?" a girl interjected timidly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a smirk.

The instructor breathed breathlessly, "Animals (also called Metazoa) are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia. With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and go through an ontogenetic stage in which their body consists of a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described—of which around 1 million are insects—but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total. Animals range in length from 8.5 micrometres (0.00033 in) to 33.6 metres (110 ft). They have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs. The scientific study of animals is known as zoology. Most living animal species are in Bilateria -"

The professor took a breath, waiting for a question from the pupils about Bilateria or some other topic.

The class stifled their yawns.

The professor proceeded.

The teacher breathed sadly, "- Bilateria, a clade whose members have a bilaterally symmetric body plan. The Bilateria include the protostomes, containing invertebrates such as nematodes, arthropods, and molluscs, and the deuterostomes, containing the echinoderms and the chordates, the latter including the vertebrates. Life -"

"What's Life?" a student questioned calmly.

The educator paid no heed to the interruption and carried on.

The educator sang excitedly, "- Life forms interpreted as early animals were present in the Ediacaran biota -"

The professor stopped, listening for a question from the pupils about Ediacaran biota or some other topic.

The class stifled their yawns.

The lecturer continued.

The teacher noted happily, "- Ediacaran biota of the late Precambrian -"

"What's Precambrian?" a student interjected aggressively.

"What's Cambrian?" a pupil raised gently.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a smile.

The professor declared, "The Cambria -"

"What's Cambria?" a girl quizzed pointedly.

The professor acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The lecturer declared patiently, "Cumbria ( KUM-bree-ə) is a ceremonial and non-metropolitan county in North West England -"

"What's England?" a pupil questioned pointedly.

The educator acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The educator declared sadly, "England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom -"

"What's United Kingdom?" a boy raised gently.

The professor acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The schoolteacher murmured mechanically, "The United Kingdom of Great Britain -"

The instructor took a breath, waiting for a query from the class about Kingdom of Great Britain or some other topic.

The lecturer proceeded.

The educator elaborated gingerly, "- Kingdom of Great Britain -"

"What's Great Britain?" a girl piped up breathlessly.

The schoolteacher paid no heed to the interruption and proceeded.

The lecturer announced, "- Great Britain and Northern Ireland -"

"What's Northern Ireland?" a student questioned quickly.

The educator acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The schoolteacher ignored the interruption and continued.

The schoolteacher sang patiently, "- Northern Ireland -"

"What's Ireland?" a pupil wondered breathlessly.

The educator disregarded the interruption and proceeded.

The lecturer explained slowly, "- Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK -"

# Lesson 26: Hill

"Good afternoon, class! Today we'll be talking about Hill," the teacher explained mechanically.

The class sniggered.

The teacher announced patiently, "A hill is a landform that extends above the surrounding terrain. It often has a distinct summit. The distinction between a hill and a mountain is unclear and largely subjective, but a hill is universally considered to be not as tall, or as steep as a mountain. Geographers historically regarded mountains as hills greater than 1,000 feet (304.8 meters) above sea level, which formed the basis of the plot of the 1995 film The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain -"

"What's The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain?" a student interjected confidently.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a grin.

The educator explained gently, "The Englishman who Went up a Hill -"

"What's Hill?" a student piped up slowly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The educator murmured pointedly, "A still is an apparatus used to distill liquid mixtures by heating to selectively boil and then cooling to condense the vapor. A still uses the same concepts as a basic distillation apparatus, but on a much larger scale. Stills have been used to produce perfume and medicine, water for injection (WFI) for pharmaceutical use, generally to separate and purify different chemicals, and to produce distilled beverages containing ethanol. Since ethanol boils at a much lower temperature than water, simple distillation can separate ethanol from water by applying heat to the mixture. Historically, a copper vessel was used for this purpose, since copper removes undesirable sulfur-based compounds from the alcohol. However, many modern stills are made of stainless steel pipes with copper linings to prevent erosion of the entire vessel and lower copper levels in the waste product (which in large distilleries is processed to become animal feed). Copper is the preferred material for stills because it yields an overall better-tasting spirit. The taste is improved by the chemical reaction between the copper in the still and the sulfur compounds created by the yeast during fermentation. These unwanted and flavor-changing sulfur compounds are chemically removed from the final product resulting in a smoother, better-tasting drink. All copper stills will require repairs about every eight years due to the precipitation of copper-sulfur compounds. The beverage industry was the first to implement a modern distillation apparatus and led the way in developing equipment standards which are now widely accepted in the chemical industry. There is also an increasing usage of the distillation of gin under glass and PTFE -"

The lecturer took a breath, expecting a query from the pupils about PTFE or some other topic.

The class suppressed giggles.

The educator proceeded.

The teacher breathed crudely, "- PTFE, and even at reduced pressures, to facilitate a fresher product. This is irrelevant to alcohol quality because the process starts with triple distilled grain alcohol, and the distillation is used solely to harvest botanical flavors such as limonene and other terpene like compounds. The ethyl alcohol is relatively unchanged. The simplest standard distillation apparatus is commonly known as a pot still, consisting of a single heated chamber and a vessel to collect purified alcohol. A pot still incorporates only one condensation, whereas other types of distillation equipment have multiple stages which result in higher purification of the more volatile component (alcohol). Pot still -"

"What's Pot still?" a boy quizzed quickly.

The educator acknowledged the question with a grin.

The teacher paid no heed to the interruption and proceeded.

The educator sang patiently, "- Pot still distillation gives an incomplete separation, but this can be desirable for the flavor of some distilled beverages. If a purer distillate is desired, a reflux still is the most common solution. Reflux -"

The lecturer took a breath, listening for a query from the students about Reflux or some other topic.

The students stifled their yawns.

The instructor proceeded.

The schoolteacher elaborated aggressively, "- Reflux still -"

"What's Reflux still?" a student said.

The educator acknowledged the query with a grin.

The schoolteacher elaborated calmly, "Reflux is a technique involving the condensation of vapors and the return of this condensate to the system from which it originated. It is used in industrial and laboratory distillations. It is also used in chemistry to supply energy to reactions over a long period of time. The term reflux is very widely used in industries that utilize large-scale distillation columns and fractionators such as petroleum refineries, petrochemical and chemical plants, and natural gas processing plants. In that context, reflux refers to the portion of the overhead liquid product from a distillation column or fractionator that is returned to the upper part of the column as shown in the schematic diagram of a typical industrial distillation column. Inside the column, the downflowing reflux liquid provides cooling and condensation of the upflowing vapors thereby increasing the efficiency of the distillation column. The more reflux provided for a given number of theoretical plates, the better is the column's separation of lower boiling materials from higher boiling materials. Conversely, for a given desired separation, the more reflux is provided, the fewer theoretical plates are required. A mixture of reactants and solvent is placed in a suitable vessel, such as a round bottom flask. This vessel is connected to a water-cooled condenser, which is typically open to the atmosphere at the top. The reaction vessel is heated in order to boil the reaction mixture; vapours produced from the mixture are condensed by the condenser, and return to the vessel through gravity. The purpose is to thermally accelerate the reaction by conducting it at an elevated, controlled temperature (i.e. the solvent's boiling point) and ambient pressure without losing large quantities of the mixture.The diagram shows a typical reflux apparatus. It includes a water bath to indirectly heat the mixture. As many solvents used are flammable, direct heating with a Bunsen burner is not generally suitable, and alternatives such as a water bath, oil bath, sand bath, electric hot plate or heating mantle are employed. The apparatus shown in the diagram represents a batch distillation as opposed to a continuous distillation. The liquid feed mixture to be distilled is placed into the round-bottomed flask along with a few anti-bumping granules, and the fractionating column is fitted into the top. As the mixture is heated and boils, vapor rises up the column. The vapor condenses on the glass platforms (known as plates or trays) inside the column and runs back down into the liquid below, thereby refluxing the upflowing distillate vapor. The hottest tray is at the bottom of the column and the coolest tray is at the top. At steady state conditions, the vapor and liquid on each tray is at equilibrium. Only the most volatile of the vapors stays in gaseous form all the way to the top. The vapor at the top of the column then passes into the condenser, where it cools until it condenses into a liquid. The separation can be enhanced with the addition of more trays (to a practical limitation of heat, flow, etc.). The process continues until all the most volatile components in the liquid feed boil out of the mixture. This point can be recognized by the rise in temperature shown on the thermometer. For continuous distillation, the feed mixture enters in the middle of the column. By controlling the temperature of the condenser, often called a dephlegmator, a reflux still may be used to ensure that higher boiling point components are returned to the flask while lighter elements are passed out to a secondary condenser. This is useful in producing high quality alcoholic beverages, while ensuring that less desirable components (such as fusel alcohols) are returned to the primary flask. For high quality neutral spirits (such as vodka), or post distillation flavored spirits (gin, absinthe), a process of multiple distillations or charcoal filtering may be applied to obtain a product lacking in any suggestion of its original source material for fermentation. The geometry of the still also plays a role in determining how much reflux occurs. In a pot still, if the tube leading from the boiler to the condenser, the lyne arm, is angled upward, more liquid will have a chance to condense and flow back into the boiler leading to increased reflux. Typical results can increase production as high as 50% over the basic worm type condenser. The addition of a copper 'boiling ball' in the path creates an area where expansion of gasses into the ball causes cooling and subsequent condensation and reflux. In a column still, the addition of inert materials in the column (e.g., packing) creates surfaces for early condensation and leads to increased reflux. Batch distillation -"

The professor paused, expecting a question from the pupils about Batch distillation or some other topic.

The pupils sat straighter in their seats.

The schoolteacher continued.

The teacher seethed confidently, "- Batch distillation Fractional distillation Fractionating column McCabe-Thiele method -"

The educator paused, expecting a query from the students about McCabe-Thiele method or some other topic.

The pupils suppressed giggles.

The educator continued.

"Now then, getting back to Still....", the professor said calmly.

The class sat straighter in their seats.

"Alright, going back to The Englishman who Went up a Hill but Came down a Mountain....", the schoolteacher murmured furiously.

The pupils stifled their yawns.

"Well then, returning to Hill....", the schoolteacher explained pointedly.

The pupils watched quietly.

The lecturer announced confidently, "- The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain -"

"What's Mountain?" a girl wondered quickly.

The educator acknowledged the question with a nervous laugh.

The professor elaborated, "A mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth -"

"What's Earth?" a girl demanded sadly.

The professor acknowledged the question with a smirk.

The lecturer paid no attention to the interruption and carried on.

The lecturer seethed crudely, "- Earth's crust, generally with steep sides that show significant exposed bedrock. A mountain differs from a plateau in having a limited summit area, and is larger than a hill, typically rising at least 300 metres (1000 feet) above the surrounding land. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in mountain ranges.Mountains are formed through tectonic forces, erosion, or volcanism, which act on time scales of up to tens of millions of years. Once mountain building ceases, mountains are slowly leveled through the action of weathering, through slumping and other forms of mass wasting, as well as through erosion by rivers and glaciers. High elevations on mountains produce colder climates than at sea level at similar latitude. These colder climates strongly affect the ecosystems of mountains: different elevations have different plants and animals. Because of the less hospitable terrain and climate, mountains tend to be used less for agriculture and more for resource extraction, such as mining and logging, along with recreation, such as mountain climbing and skiing. The highest mountain on Earth is Mount Everest in the Himalayas -"

The schoolteacher paused, waiting for a question from the class about Himalayas or some other topic.

The class listened in rapt attention.

The professor proceeded.

The professor explained crudely, "- Himalayas of Asia -"

The schoolteacher stopped, listening for a query from the students about Asia or some other topic.

The teacher proceeded.

The educator seethed breathlessly, "- Asia, whose summit is 8,850 m (29,035 ft) above mean sea level. The highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System is Olympus Mons -"

"What's Olympus Mons?" a boy questioned quickly.

The educator acknowledged the query with a grin.

The professor disregarded the interruption and carried on.

The teacher murmured crudely, "- Olympus Mons on Mars at 21,171 m (69,459 ft). There is no universally accepted definition of a mountain. Elevation, volume, relief, steepness, spacing and continuity have been used as criteria for defining a mountain. In the Oxford English Dictionary a mountain is defined as 'a natural elevation of the earth surface rising more or less abruptly from the surrounding level and attaining an altitude which, relatively to the adjacent elevation, is impressive or notable.'Whether a landform is called a mountain may depend on local usage. Mount Scott outside Lawton, Oklahoma -"

The teacher took a breath, expecting a query from the pupils about Lawton, Oklahoma or some other topic.

The pupils listened in rapt attention.

The professor carried on.

The teacher announced patiently, "- Lawton, Oklahoma, USA, is only 251 m (823 ft) from its base to its highest point. Whittow's Dictionary of Physical Geography states 'Some authorities regard eminences above 600 metres (1,969 ft) as mountains, those below being referred to as hills.' In the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland -"

The educator paused, expecting a query from the students about Ireland or some other topic.

The teacher proceeded.

The educator announced quietly, "- Ireland, a mountain is usually defined as any summit at least 2,000 feet (610 m) high, which accords with the official UK government's definition that a mountain, for the purposes of access, is a summit of 2,000 feet (610 m) or higher. In addition, some definitions also include a topographical prominence requirement, such as that the mountain rises 300 metres (984 ft) above the surrounding terrain. At one time the U.S. Board on Geographic Names defined a mountain as being 1,000 feet (305 m) or taller, but has abandoned the definition since the 1970s. Any similar landform lower than this height was considered a hill. However, today, the United States Geological Survey -"

"What's United States Geological Survey?" a boy wondered quietly.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a nod.

The lecturer muttered, "The United States -"

"What's United States?" a pupil raised timidly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a smile.

The lecturer seethed politely, "The United States of America -"

"What's America?" a boy interjected calmly.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a smile.

The schoolteacher seethed patiently, "The United States of America -"

"What's The United States of America?" a boy queried sadly.

The educator acknowledged the query with a nod.

The educator breathed aggressively, "The United States of America -"

"What's America?" a pupil blurted quickly.

The professor acknowledged the question with a smile.

The lecturer seethed carefully, "The United States of America -"

The lecturer paused, listening for a question from the students about The United States of America or some other topic.

The pupils listened in rapt attention.

The professor proceeded.

The instructor noted quietly, "- The United States of America -"

The instructor took a breath, listening for a question from the pupils about America or some other topic.

The class stifled their yawns.

The educator proceeded.

The educator breathed confidently, "- America (U.S.A. or USA -"

The schoolteacher looked around, listening for a query from the students about USA or some other topic.

The teacher proceeded.

The lecturer explained sullenly, "- USA), commonly known as the United States (U.S. or US) or America, is a country primarily located in North America -"

The instructor paused, expecting a query from the pupils about North America or some other topic.

The schoolteacher proceeded.

The instructor muttered quickly, "- North America. It consists of 50 states, a federal district, five major unincorporated territories, 326 Indian reservation -"

The educator paused, listening for a query from the students about Indian reservation or some other topic.

The students stifled their yawns.

The schoolteacher carried on.

The schoolteacher declared happily, "- Indian reservations, and some minor possessions. At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million square kilometers), it is the world's third- or fourth-largest country by total area. The United States shares significant land borders with Canada -"

The lecturer stopped, waiting for a question from the students about Canada or some other topic.

The pupils stifled their yawns.

The teacher continued.

The instructor declared excitedly, "- Canada to the north and Mexico -"

"What's Mexico?" a student wondered sullenly.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a smirk.

The teacher explained aggressively, "Mexico, officially the United Mexican States -"

"What's United Mexican States?" a student piped up quietly.

The instructor acknowledged the question with a nod.

The teacher explained furiously, "Mexico, officially the United Mexican States -"

"What's United Mexican States?" a girl interjected quietly.

The instructor acknowledged the question with a nod.

The teacher explained happily, "Mexico, officially the United Mexica -"

"What's Mexica?" a student asked aggressively.

The professor acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The schoolteacher announced quietly, "Mexico, officially the United Mexican States -"

"What's United Mexican States?" a girl interjected slowly.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a nervous laugh.

The schoolteacher said breathlessly, "Mexico, officially the United Mexican States -"

The educator halted, listening for a question from the students about United Mexican States or some other topic.

The pupils listened in rapt attention.

The teacher continued.

The teacher said politely, "- United Mexica -"

"What's Mexica?" a boy blurted calmly.

The lecturer paid no heed to the interruption and proceeded.

The instructor muttered pointedly, "- Mexican States, is a country in the southern portion of North America. It is bordered to the north by the United States -"

The teacher looked around, waiting for a query from the pupils about United States or some other topic.

The students suppressed giggles.

The schoolteacher proceeded.

The professor explained carefully, "- United States; to the south and west by the Pacific -"

"What's Pacific?" a student said patiently.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The teacher breathed sullenly, "The Pacific -"

The professor paused, anticipating a question from the pupils about Pacific or some other topic.

The students suppressed giggles.

The lecturer continued.

The educator murmured quickly, "- Pacific Ocean -"

The educator paused, waiting for a question from the class about Ocean or some other topic.

The students suppressed giggles.

The teacher carried on.

The teacher seethed quietly, "- Ocean is the largest and deepest of Earth -"

The educator paused, listening for a question from the class about Earth or some other topic.

The pupils stifled their yawns.

The instructor proceeded.

The lecturer muttered politely, "- Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean -"

"What's Arctic Ocean?" a girl raised happily.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The schoolteacher murmured pointedly, "The Arctic -"

"What's Arctic?" a boy quizzed furiously.

The teacher paid no heed to the interruption and proceeded.

The schoolteacher declared crudely, "- Arctic Ocean -"

"What's Ocean?" a boy demanded timidly.

The teacher ignored the interruption and proceeded.

The instructor murmured excitedly, "- Ocean is the smallest and shallowest of the world's five major oceans. It spans an area of approximately 14,060,000 km2 (5,430,000 sq mi) and is also known as the coldest of all the oceans. The International Hydrographic Organization -"

The educator looked around, listening for a question from the students about International Hydrographic Organization or some other topic.

The class suppressed giggles.

The professor carried on.

"Well then, returning to Pacific Ocean....", the educator explained calmly.

The class sniggered.

"Now then, returning to Mexico....", the schoolteacher explained quickly.

# Lesson 27: Jeremy Sims

"Hello and welcome, class! Today we'll be talking about Jeremy Sims," the schoolteacher sang slowly.

The pupils sniggered.

The instructor breathed quickly, "Jeremy Hartley Sims (born 10 January 1966) is an Australian actor and director. Jeremy Sims was born in Perth -"

"What's Perth?" a student raised crudely.

The instructor acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The educator noted, "Death is the permanent, irreversible cessation of all biological functions that sustain a living organism. Brain death -"

"What's Brain death?" a pupil piped up pointedly.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The schoolteacher declared gently, "Brain death is the complete loss of brain function, including involuntary activity necessary to sustain life. It differs from persistent vegetative state, in which the person is alive and some autonomic functions remain. It is also distinct from comas as long as some brain and bodily activity and function remain, and it is also not the same as the condition locked-in syndrome. A differential diagnosis can medically distinguish these differing conditions. Brain death is used as an indicator of legal death in many jurisdictions, but it is defined inconsistently and often confused by the public. Various parts of the brain may keep functioning when others do not anymore, and the term 'brain death' has been used to refer to various combinations. For example, although one major medical dictionary considers 'brain death' to be synonymous with 'cerebral death' (death of the cerebrum), the US National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings -"

The educator paused, anticipating a query from the students about Medical Subject Headings or some other topic.

The class listened in rapt attention.

The schoolteacher continued.

The instructor declared slowly, "- Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) system defines brain death as including the brainstem. The distinctions are medically significant because, for example, in someone with a dead cerebrum but a living brainstem, spontaneous breathing may continue unaided, whereas in whole-brain death (which includes brainstem death), only life support equipment would maintain ventilation. In certain countries, patients classified as brain-dead may legally have their organs surgically removed for organ donation. Differences in operational definitions of death have obvious medicolegal implications (in medical jurisprudence and medical law). Traditionally, both the legal and medical communities determined death through the permanent end of certain bodily functions in clinical death, especially respiration and heartbeat. With the increasing ability of the medical community to resuscitate people with no respiration, heartbeat, or other external signs of life, the need for another definition of death occurred, raising questions of legal death. This gained greater urgency with the widespread use of life support equipment and the rising capabilities and demand for organ transplantation. Since the 1960s, laws governing the determination of death have been implemented in all countries that have active organ transplantation programs. The first European country to adopt brain death as a legal definition (or indicator) of death was Finland -"

The lecturer paused, anticipating a question from the pupils about Finland or some other topic.

The lecturer proceeded.

The lecturer breathed pointedly, "- Finland in 1971, while in the United States, the state of Kansas -"

"What's Kansas?" a girl queried sadly.

The educator acknowledged the query with a nod.

The professor murmured quietly, "Kansas ( (listen)) is a state in the Midwestern United States -"

The schoolteacher stopped, listening for a query from the class about Midwestern United States or some other topic.

The pupils watched quietly.

The teacher carried on.

The lecturer said crudely, "- Midwestern United States -"

"What's United States?" a pupil quizzed sadly.

The instructor acknowledged the query with a grin.

The schoolteacher declared crudely, "The United States of America -"

"What's America?" a pupil piped up happily.

The educator acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The educator said gingerly, "The United States of America -"

The schoolteacher took a breath, waiting for a question from the students about The United States of America or some other topic.

The class listened in rapt attention.

The schoolteacher continued.

The educator declared excitedly, "- The United States of America (U.S.A. or US -"

"What's US?" a boy piped up gingerly.

The lecturer paused, listening for a question from the students about US or some other topic.

The instructor continued.

The schoolteacher breathed carefully, "- USA -"

The instructor looked around, waiting for a question from the class about USA or some other topic.

The educator declared gently, "- North America. It consists of 50 states, a federal district, five major unincorporated territories, 326 Indian reservations -"

"What's Indian reservations?" a pupil blurted excitedly.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The instructor seethed excitedly, "An Indian reservation is an area of land tenure governed by a federally recognized Native American tribal nation under the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs -"

The educator paused, expecting a query from the pupils about Bureau of Indian Affairs or some other topic.

The class suppressed giggles.

The professor proceeded.

The schoolteacher declared calmly, "- Bureau of Indian Affairs, rather than by the government of the state in which it is located. The 326 Indian reservations in the United States -"

The schoolteacher looked around, anticipating a query from the class about United States or some other topic.

The lecturer continued.

The instructor elaborated aggressively, "- United States are associated with specific Native American nations, often on a one-to-one basis. Some of the country's 574 federally recognized tribes govern more than one reservation, while some share reservations, and others have no reservation at all. In addition, because of past land allotments, leading to sales to non–Native Americans, some reservations are severely fragmented, with each piece of tribal, individual, and privately held land being a separate enclave. This jumble of private and public real estate creates significant administrative, political and legal difficulties.The collective geographical area of all reservations is 56,200,000 acres (22,700,000 ha; 87,800 sq mi; 227,000 km2), approximately the size of the state of Idaho -"

The schoolteacher looked around, anticipating a query from the pupils about Idaho or some other topic.

The pupils sniggered.

The professor proceeded.

The educator murmured happily, "- Idaho. While most reservations are small compared to U.S. state -"

The instructor paused, expecting a question from the class about U.S. state or some other topic.

The class watched quietly.

The lecturer continued.

The educator elaborated sadly, "- U.S. states, there are twelve Indian reservations larger than the state of Rhode Island. The largest reservation, the Navajo Nation Reservation, is similar in size to West Virginia -"

The lecturer took a breath, listening for a question from the class about West Virginia or some other topic.

The pupils sniggered.

The lecturer proceeded.

"So, returning to United States....", the lecturer noted sullenly.

The lecturer took a breath, expecting a query from the class about Missouri River or some other topic.

The students listened in rapt attention.

The professor continued.

The teacher breathed furiously, "- Missouri River drainage, which is in turn the northwesternmost portion of the extensive Mississippi River drainage. Its two names both come from the Kanza (Kaw) people who once inhabited the area; Kansas was one of the anglicizations of the French transcription Cansez (IPA: [kɑ̃ze]) of the original kką:ze.

The lecturer took a breath, expecting a query from the class about Kansas River or some other topic.

The pupils stifled their yawns.

The professor proceeded.

The teacher declared gently, "- Kansas River, which in turn was named after the Kansa Native Americans who lived along its banks. The tribe's name (natively kką:ze) is often said to mean 'people of the (south) wind' although this was probably not the term's original meaning. For thousands of years, what is now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes. Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys. Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of bison. The first Euro-American settlement in Kansas occurred in 1827 at Fort Leavenworth -"

"What's Fort Leavenworth?" a student demanded pointedly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a smirk.

The lecturer breathed, "Fort Leavenworth is a United States Army -"

The instructor stopped, expecting a question from the class about United States Army or some other topic.

"What's Sacramento River?" a student questioned politely.

The professor acknowledged the query with a smile.

The educator seethed carefully, "The Sacramento River (Spanish: Río Sacramento) is the principal river of Northern California -"

"What's Northern California?" a boy demanded slowly.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a nervous laugh.

The lecturer disregarded the interruption and continued.

The professor declared furiously, "- Northern California in the United States and is the largest river in California. Rising in the Klamath Mountains -"

The schoolteacher paused, waiting for a query from the pupils about Klamath Mountains or some other topic.

The class listened in rapt attention.

The lecturer proceeded.

The educator breathed timidly, "- Klamath Mountains, the river flows south for 400 miles (640 km) before reaching the Sacramento–San Joaquin River -"

"What's San Joaquin River?" a pupil wondered pointedly.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The educator noted patiently, "The San Joaquin River (; Spanish: Río San Joaquín) is the longest river of Central California -"

"What's Central California?" a pupil questioned timidly.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a nod.

The educator noted confidently, "Central California -"

"What's California?" a student questioned crudely.

The teacher paid no heed to the interruption and proceeded.

The instructor announced furiously, "- California is generally thought of as the middle third of the state, north of Southern California -"

"What's Southern California?" a pupil quizzed sullenly.

The educator acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The educator noted mechanically, "Southern California -"

The lecturer paused, listening for a question from the students about California or some other topic.

The students listened in rapt attention.

The instructor continued.

The professor murmured calmly, "- California (popularly known as SoCal; Spanish: Sur de California) is a geographic and cultural region that generally comprises the southern portion of the U.S. state -"

The teacher took a breath, anticipating a question from the class about U.S. state or some other topic.

The class stifled their yawns.

The schoolteacher proceeded.

"So, back again to Central California....", the schoolteacher murmured excitedly.

The class sat straighter in their seats.

"Now, getting back to San Joaquin River....", the professor elaborated furiously.

The class suppressed giggles.

"Now then, getting back to Sacramento River....", the lecturer elaborated sullenly.

The class suppressed giggles.

"Alright, going back to Concord Naval Weapons Station....", the schoolteacher explained timidly.

The pupils sat straighter in their seats.

"Okay, back again to List of United States Navy installations....", the schoolteacher announced.

The class sat straighter in their seats.

"Well then, returning to List of former United States Army installations....", the educator sang happily.

The class listened in rapt attention.

"Okay, getting back to Fort Leavenworth....", the schoolteacher breathed sullenly.

The students watched quietly.

"Alright, back again to Kansas....", the educator sang excitedly.

The students sniggered.

"Now, returning to Kansas City, Missouri....", the lecturer muttered furiously.

The students watched quietly.

"Now then, going back to Kansas River....", the professor muttered crudely.

The students listened in rapt attention.

"Now then, back again to Topeka, Kansas....", the educator muttered.

The pupils suppressed giggles.

"Well then, going back to Kansas....", the lecturer breathed robotically.

The students watched quietly.

"Well then, back again to Brain death....", the schoolteacher murmured carefully.

The class suppressed giggles.

"Well then, turning back our attention to Death....", the professor noted politely.

The class sniggered.

"Now then, returning to Jeremy Sims....", the instructor explained slowly.

The students watched quietly.

The bell sounded.

"That's all the time we have. I hope you learned something today," the professor murmured quickly.

The pupils exited the room carefully.
