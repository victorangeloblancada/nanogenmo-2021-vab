# Lesson 1: Generative systems

"Hello and welcome, class! Today we'll be discussing Generative systems," the instructor breathed calmly.

The students stifled their yawns.

The educator explained carefully, "Generative systems are technologies with the overall capacity to produce unprompted change driven by large, varied, and uncoordinated audiences. When generative systems provide a common platform, changes may occur at varying layers (physical, network, application, content) and provide a means through which different firms and individuals may cooperate indirectly and contribute to innovation.Depending on the rules, the patterns can be extremely varied and unpredictable. One of the better-known examples is Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton. Other examples include Boids and Wikipedia -"

"What's Wikipedia?" a student demanded sadly.

The professor disregarded the interruption and continued.

The educator sang quickly, "- Wikipedia. More examples can be found in generative music, generative art, and, more recently, in video games such as Spore. In 2006, Jonathan Zittrain -"

"Who's Jonathan Zittrain?" a boy demanded gently.

The professor acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The lecturer murmured calmly, "Jonathan L. Zittrain (born 24 December 1969) is an American professor of Internet -"

"What's Internet?" a pupil demanded mechanically.

The professor acknowledged the query with a nervous laugh.

The professor muttered quickly, "Interest, in finance and economics, is payment from a borrower or deposit-taking financial institution to a lender or depositor of an amount above repayment of the principal sum (that is, the amount borrowed), at a particular rate. It is distinct from a fee which the borrower may pay the lender or some third party. It is also distinct from dividend which is paid by a company to its shareholders (owners) from its profit or reserve, but not at a particular rate decided beforehand, rather on a pro rata basis as a share in the reward gained by risk taking entrepreneurs when the revenue earned exceeds the total costs.For example, a customer would usually pay interest to borrow from a bank, so they pay the bank an amount which is more than the amount they borrowed; or a customer may earn interest on their savings, and so they may withdraw more than they originally deposited. In the case of savings, the customer is the lender, and the bank plays the role of the borrower. Interest differs from profit, in that interest is received by a lender, whereas profit is received by the owner of an asset, investment or enterprise. (Interest may be part or the whole of the profit on an investment, but the two concepts are distinct from each other from an accounting perspective.) The rate of interest is equal to the interest amount paid or received over a particular period divided by the principal sum borrowed or lent (usually expressed as a percentage). Compound interest means that interest is earned on prior interest in addition to the principal. Due to compounding, the total amount of debt grows exponentially, and its mathematical study led to the discovery of the number e. In practice, interest is most often calculated on a daily, monthly, or yearly basis, and its impact is influenced greatly by its compounding rate. According to historian Paul Johnson, the lending of 'food money' was commonplace in Middle East -"

"What's Middle East?" a boy wondered sadly.

The teacher paid no attention to the interruption and carried on.

The schoolteacher seethed robotically, "- Middle Eastern civilizations as early as 5000 BC. The argument that acquired seeds and animals could reproduce themselves was used to justify interest, but ancient Jewish -"

"What's Jewish?" a boy questioned quickly.

The vast majority of human activity throughout history has occurred in land areas that support agriculture, habitat, and various natural resources. Some life forms, including terrestrial plants and terrestrial animals, have developed from predecessor species that originated in bodies of water. Areas where land meets large bodies of water are called coastal zones. The division between land and water is a fundamental concept to humans. The demarcation line between land and water can vary by local jurisdiction and other factors. A maritime boundary is one example of a political demarcation. A variety of natural boundaries exist to help clearly define where water meets land. Solid rock landforms are easier to demarcate than marshy or swampy boundaries, where there is no clear point at which the land ends and a body of water has begun. Demarcation line -"

The schoolteacher said breathlessly, "An army (from Latin arma 'arms, weapons' via Old French armée, 'armed' [feminine]), ground force or land force is a fighting force that fights primarily on land. In the broadest sense, it is the land-based military branch, service branch or armed service of a nation or state. It may also include aviation assets by possessing an army aviation component. Within a national military force, the word army may also mean a field army. In some countries, such as France and China, the term 'army', especially in its plural form 'armies', has the broader meaning of armed forces as a whole, while retaining the colloquial sense of land forces. To differentiate the colloquial army from the formal concept of military force, the term is qualified, for example in France the land force is called Armée de terre, meaning Land Army, and the air and space force is called Armée de l'Air et de l’Espace, meaning Air and Space Army. The naval force, although not using the term 'army', is also included in the broad sense of the term 'armies' — thus the French Navy -"

"What's Navy?" a girl said excitedly.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a smirk.

The schoolteacher said quietly, "A navy, naval force, or maritime force is the branch of a nation's armed forces principally designated for naval and amphibious warfare; namely, lake-borne, riverine, littoral, or ocean-borne combat operations and related functions. It includes anything conducted by surface ships, amphibious ships, submarines, and seaborne aviation, as well as ancillary support, communications, training, and other fields. The strategic offensive role of a navy is projection of force into areas beyond a country's shores (for example, to protect sea-lanes, deter or confront piracy, ferry troops, or attack other navies, ports, or shore installations). The strategic defensive purpose of a navy is to frustrate seaborne projection-of-force by enemies. The strategic task of the navy also may incorporate nuclear deterrence by use of submarine-launched ballistic missiles. Naval operations can be broadly divided between riverine and littoral applications (brown-water navy), open-ocean applications (blue-water navy), and something in between (green-water navy), although these distinctions are more about strategic scope than tactical or operational division. First attested in English in the early 14th century, the word 'navy' came via Old French navie, 'fleet of ships', from the Latin navigium, 'a vessel, a ship, bark, boat', from navis, 'ship'. The word 'naval' came from Latin navalis, 'pertaining to ship'; cf. Greek ναῦς (naus), 'ship', ναύτης (nautes), 'seaman, sailor'. The earliest attested form of the word is in the Mycenaean Greek -"

"What's Mycenaean Greek?" a student blurted excitedly.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a smile.

# Lesson 4: Abdoulay Diaby

"Hello and welcome, class! Today we'll be talking about Abdoulay Diaby," the professor breathed confidently.

The class watched quietly.

The teacher seethed confidently, "Abdoulay Diaby (born 21 May 1991) is a professional footballer who plays mainly as a left winger for Al Jazira. Born in France -"

"What's France?" a boy queried robotically.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a smirk.

The instructor noted excitedly, "France (French: [fʁɑ̃s] ), officially the French Republic -"

"What's French Republic?" a boy questioned quietly.

The instructor acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The lecturer seethed patiently, "France (French: [fʁɑ̃s] ), officially the French Republic -"

"What's French Republic?" a pupil asked quietly.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The teacher announced sullenly, "France (French: [fʁɑ̃s] ), officially the French Republic -"

"What's Republic?" a girl quizzed furiously.

The instructor paid no heed to the interruption and proceeded.

The educator breathed gingerly, "- Republic (French: République française), is a transcontinental country spanning Western Europe -"

"What's Western Europe?" a girl demanded crudely.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The lecturer murmured calmly, "Western Europe is the European region farthest from Asia -"

"What's Asia?" a girl demanded breathlessly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a nod.

The educator elaborated breathlessly, "Asia ( (listen)) is Earth -"

"What's Earth?" a student raised pointedly.

The instructor paid no heed to the interruption and proceeded.

The professor breathed carefully, "- Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the Eastern and Northern Hemisphere -"

"What's Northern Hemisphere?" a girl demanded.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The professor said patiently, "The North -"

"What's North?" a student interjected happily.

The teacher ignored the interruption and proceeded.

The instructor breathed happily, "- Northern Hemisphere is the half of the Earth -"

"What's Earth?" a girl blurted.

The instructor acknowledged the query with a nervous laugh.

The instructor ignored the interruption and carried on.

The educator declared aggressively, "- Earth that is north of the Equator -"

"What's Equator?" a girl quizzed gently.

The teacher disregarded the interruption and continued.

The lecturer elaborated aggressively, "- Equator. For other planets in the Solar System -"

The instructor halted, expecting a question from the class about Solar System or some other topic.

The class stifled their yawns.

The professor continued.

The educator breathed, "- Solar System, north is defined as being in the same celestial hemisphere relative to the invariable plane of the solar system as Earth's North Pole -"

The teacher took a breath, listening for a question from the students about North Pole or some other topic.

The class suppressed giggles.

The instructor proceeded.

The educator elaborated excitedly, "- North Pole.Owing to the Earth's axial tilt of 23.439281°, winter in the Northern Hemisphere lasts from the December solstice (typically December 21 UTC) to the March equinox (typically March 20 UTC), while summer lasts from the June solstice through to the September equinox (typically on 23 September UTC). The dates vary each year due to the difference between the calendar year and the astronomical year. Within the northern hemisphere, oceanic currents can change the weather patterns that affect many factors within the north coast. Such events include ENSO (El Niño-Southern Oscillation -"

"What's El Niño-Southern Oscillation?" a boy said gingerly.

The professor acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The educator muttered mechanically, "El Niño -"

The educator took a breath, expecting a question from the pupils about El Niño or some other topic.

The educator continued.

The lecturer murmured patiently, "- El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO -"

The schoolteacher looked around, expecting a query from the class about ENSO or some other topic.

The pupils listened in rapt attention.

The lecturer continued.

The teacher breathed gingerly, "- ENSO) is an irregular periodic variation in winds and sea surface temperatures over the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean -"

"What's Pacific Ocean?" a boy queried furiously.

The teacher ignored the interruption and continued.

The teacher elaborated gently, "- Pacific Ocean, affecting the climate of much of the tropics and subtropics. The warming phase of the sea temperature is known as El Niño and the cooling phase as La Niña -"

The professor halted, listening for a question from the class about La Niña or some other topic.

The students listened in rapt attention.

The instructor continued.

The lecturer sang gingerly, "- La Niña. The Southern Oscillation is the accompanying atmospheric component, coupled with the sea temperature change: El Niño is accompanied by high air surface pressure in the tropical western Pacific and La Niña with low air surface pressure there. The two periods last several months each and typically occur every few years with varying intensity per period.The two phases relate to the Walker circulation -"

"What's Walker circulation?" a girl raised furiously.

The instructor disregarded the interruption and proceeded.

The lecturer seethed timidly, "- Walker circulation, which was discovered by Gilbert Walker during the early twentieth century. The Walker circulation is caused by the pressure gradient force that results from a high-pressure area over the eastern Pacific Ocean, and a low-pressure system over Indonesia -"

The educator stopped, anticipating a question from the students about Indonesia or some other topic.

The pupils suppressed giggles.

The educator proceeded.

The educator muttered quickly, "- Indonesia. Weakening or reversal of the Walker circulation (which includes the trade winds) decreases or eliminates the upwelling of cold deep sea water, thus creating El Niño by causing the ocean surface to reach above average temperatures. An especially strong Walker circulation causes La Niña, resulting in cooler ocean temperatures due to increased upwelling. Mechanisms that cause the oscillation remain under study. The extremes of this climate pattern's oscillations cause extreme weather (such as floods and droughts) in many regions of the world. Developing countries dependent upon agriculture and fishing, particularly those bordering the Pacific Ocean, are the most affected. The El Niño–Southern Oscillation is a single climate phenomenon that periodically fluctuates between three phases: Neutral, La Niña or El Niño. La Niña and El Niño are opposite phases which require certain changes to take place in both the ocean and the atmosphere before an event is declared.Normally the northward flowing Humboldt Current -"

"What's Humboldt Current?" a student questioned calmly.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a nod.

The lecturer murmured confidently, "The Humboldt Current, also called the Peru Current, is a cold, low-salinity ocean current that flows north along the western coast of South America. It is an eastern boundary current flowing in the direction of the equator, and extends 500–1,000 km (310–620 mi) offshore. The Humboldt Current is named after the German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt -"

The schoolteacher looked around, waiting for a question from the pupils about Alexander von Humboldt or some other topic.

The class listened in rapt attention.

The instructor proceeded.

The lecturer declared excitedly, "- Alexander von Humboldt. In 1846, von Humboldt reported measurements of the cold-water current in his book Cosmos.The current extends from southern Chile -"

"What's Chile?" a pupil queried sullenly.

The teacher disregarded the interruption and continued.

The teacher breathed aggressively, "- Chile (~45th parallel south -"

"What's 45th parallel south?" a student piped up confidently.

The lecturer paid no heed to the interruption and proceeded.

The instructor murmured quietly, "- 45th parallel south -"

"What's 5th parallel south?" a girl questioned sullenly.

The professor paid no heed to the interruption and continued.

The schoolteacher muttered sadly, "- 5th parallel south) to northern Peru (~4th parallel south) where cold, upwelled, waters intersect warm tropical waters to form the Equatorial Front. Sea surface temperatures off the coast of Peru, around 5th parallel south, reach temperatures as low as 16 °C (61 °F). This is highly uncharacteristic of tropical waters, as most other regions have temperatures measuring above 25 °C (77 °F). Upwelling brings nutrients to the surface, which support phytoplankton and ultimately increase biological productivity.The Humboldt Current is a highly productive ecosystem. It is the most productive eastern boundary current system. It accounts for roughly 18-20% of the total worldwide marine fish catch. The species are mostly pelagic: sardines, anchovies and jack mackerel. The system's high productivity supports other important fishery resources as well as marine mammals (eared seals and cetaceans) and seabirds. Periodically, the upwelling that drives the system's productivity is disrupted by the El Niño -"

"What's El Niño?" a boy questioned breathlessly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the query with a nervous laugh.

The lecturer ignored the interruption and continued.

"Okay, returning to El Niño–Southern Oscillation....", the educator declared confidently.

The students listened in rapt attention.

"Now, returning to Northern Hemisphere....", the schoolteacher murmured mechanically.

The students sniggered.

"Well then, getting back to Asia....", the schoolteacher breathed politely.

The students sat straighter in their seats.

"Now then, turning back our attention to Western Europe....", the instructor sang politely.

The pupils sat straighter in their seats.

"Now then, back again to France....", the schoolteacher announced furiously.

The pupils sat straighter in their seats.

"So, returning to France....", the schoolteacher breathed crudely.

The pupils watched quietly.

"Now, turning back our attention to France....", the teacher breathed calmly.

The pupils watched quietly.

"Now then, going back to Abdoulay Diaby....", the lecturer murmured slowly.

The class listened in rapt attention.

The bell rang.

"That's all the time we have. I hope you learned something today," the lecturer said aggressively.

The pupils exited the room sadly.

The schoolteacher said quickly, "- Gmina Sława -"

The educator paused, anticipating a question from the pupils about Gmina Sława or some other topic.

The students sat straighter in their seats.

The educator carried on.

The professor said pointedly, "- Gmina Sława -"

"What's Sława?" a pupil queried politely.

The educator paid no attention to the interruption and continued.

The teacher explained sullenly, "- Sława, within Wschowa County -"

"What's Wschowa County?" a girl asked quietly.

The lecturer ignored the interruption and proceeded.

The schoolteacher said pointedly, "- Wschowa County, Lubusz Voivodeship -"

"What's Lubusz Voivodeship?" a pupil blurted gingerly.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The professor said robotically, "Lubusz Voivode -"

"What's Voivode?" a student piped up sadly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The instructor muttered timidly, "Voivode (, also spelled Voievod, Voivoda, Vojvoda or Wojewoda) is a title denoting a 'military-leader' or 'warlord' in Central, Southeastern and Eastern Europe -"

The schoolteacher stopped, expecting a query from the students about Eastern Europe or some other topic.

The students suppressed giggles.

The educator continued.

The professor noted excitedly, "- Eastern Europe since the Earl -"

"What's Earl?" a girl quizzed politely.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a smile.

The educator murmured sadly, "The Early Middle Ages or Early Medieval -"

The professor paused, listening for a query from the students about Medieval or some other topic.

The pupils suppressed giggles.

The professor continued.

The instructor noted aggressively, "- Medieval Period, sometimes referred to as the Dark Ages, is typically regarded by historians as lasting from the late 5th or early 6th century to the 10th century. They marked the start of the Middle Ages of Europe -"

"What's Europe?" a pupil demanded robotically.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The lecturer breathed happily, "Euro -"

"What's Euro?" a student questioned happily.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The professor noted quickly, "Europe is a continent located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere -"

"What's Northern Hemisphere?" a girl queried politely.

The schoolteacher paid no heed to the interruption and proceeded.

The schoolteacher announced robotically, "- Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere -"

"What's Eastern Hemisphere?" a pupil interjected excitedly.

The educator acknowledged the question with a grin.

The lecturer explained calmly, "The West -"

"What's West?" a pupil piped up timidly.

The instructor acknowledged the question with a nod.

The educator explained excitedly, "West or Occident -"

"What's Occident?" a student raised.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a nod.

The instructor ignored the interruption and proceeded.

The lecturer elaborated furiously, "- Occident is one of the four cardinal directions or points of the compass. It is the opposite direction from East -"

The professor paused, waiting for a question from the pupils about East or some other topic.

The students stifled their yawns.

The teacher proceeded.

The schoolteacher muttered gingerly, "- East and is the direction in which the sun sets. The word 'west' is a Germanic word passed into some Romance languages -"

"What's Romance languages?" a student blurted happily.

The professor acknowledged the question with a smirk.

The educator paid no attention to the interruption and proceeded.

The teacher announced quietly, "- Romance languages (ouest in French, oest in Catalan, ovest in Italian, oeste in Spanish and Portuguese). As in other languages, the word formation stems from the fact that west is the direction of the setting sun in the evening: 'west' derives from the Indo-European root *wes reduced from *wes-pero 'evening, night', cognate with Ancient Greek ἕσπερος hesperos 'evening; evening star; western' and Latin vesper 'evening; west'. Examples of the same formation in other languages include Latin occidens 'west' from occidō 'to go down, to set' and Hebrew מַעֲרָב maarav 'west' from עֶרֶב erev 'evening'. To go west using a compass for navigation (in a place where magnetic north is the same direction as true north) one needs to set a bearing or azimuth of 270°. West is the direction opposite that of the Earth's rotation on its axis, and is therefore the general direction towards which the Sun appears to constantly progress and eventually set. This is not true on the planet Venus, which rotates in the opposite direction from the Earth (retrograde rotation). To an observer on the surface of Venus, the Sun would rise in the west and set in the east although Venus's opaque clouds prevent observing the Sun from the planet's surface.In a map with north at the top, west is on the left. Moving continuously west is following a circle of latitude. Due to the direction of the Earth's rotation, the prevailing wind in many places in the middle latitudes (i.e. between 35 and 65 degrees latitude) is from the west, known as the westerlies. The phrase 'the West' is often spoken in reference to the Western world -"

The educator stopped, anticipating a query from the pupils about Western world or some other topic.

The students listened in rapt attention.

The educator proceeded.

"Alright, back again to Western Hemisphere....", the schoolteacher murmured.

The class suppressed giggles.

"Now then, back again to Europe....", the teacher murmured breathlessly.

The class listened in rapt attention.

"Well then, getting back to Europe....", the instructor seethed calmly.

The schoolteacher breathed gently, "- Europe is a continent located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere -"

"What's Northern Hemisphere?" a student quizzed pointedly.

The professor acknowledged the query with a smile.

The professor noted furiously, "The Northern Hemisphere is the half of the Earth -"

The lecturer took a breath, anticipating a question from the pupils about Earth or some other topic.

The pupils listened in rapt attention.

The educator continued.

The lecturer explained patiently, "- Earth that is north of the Equator. For other planets in the Solar System -"

The teacher halted, waiting for a question from the students about Solar System or some other topic.

The teacher proceeded.

The instructor announced, "- Solar System, north is defined as being in the same celestial hemisphere relative to the invariable plane of the solar system as Earth's North Pole -"

"What's North Pole?" a pupil blurted calmly.

The instructor acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The teacher breathed gingerly, "The South Pole, also known as the Geographic South Pole or Terrestrial South Pole, is one of the two points where Earth's axis of rotation intersects its surface. It is the southernmost point on the surface of Earth and lies on the opposite side of Earth from the North Pole. Situated on the continent of Antarctica -"

"What's Antarctica?" a boy asked excitedly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The professor breathed mechanically, "The Antarctic ( or , US English also or ; commonly ) is a polar region around Earth -"

"What's Earth?" a student piped up happily.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a smile.

The instructor paid no heed to the interruption and proceeded.

The lecturer sang patiently, "- Earth's South Pole -"

"What's South Pole?" a girl demanded politely.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a nervous laugh.

The instructor noted, "The South Pole, also known as the Geographic South Pole or Terrestrial South Pole, is one of the two points where Earth's axis of rotation intersects its surface.

The educator took a breath, listening for a question from the students about Antarctica or some other topic.

The pupils sat straighter in their seats.

The teacher continued.

The schoolteacher breathed gingerly, "- Antarctica, it is the site of the United States Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station, which was established in 1956 and has been permanently staffed since that year. The Geographic South Pole is distinct from the South Magnetic Pole, the position of which is defined based on Earth's magnetic field. The South Pole is at the centre of the Southern Hemisphere -"

The lecturer halted, anticipating a query from the students about Southern Hemisphere or some other topic.

The class stifled their yawns.

The professor proceeded.

The educator noted calmly, "- Southern Hemisphere. For most purposes, the Geographic South Pole is defined as the southern point of the two points where Earth's axis of rotation intersects its surface (the other being the Geographic North Pole). However, Earth's axis of rotation is actually subject to very small 'wobbles' (polar motion), so this definition is not adequate for very precise work. The geographic coordinates of the South Pole are usually given simply as 90°S, since its longitude is geometrically undefined and irrelevant. When a longitude is desired, it may be given as 0°. At the South Pole, all directions face north. For this reason, directions at the Pole are given relative to 'grid north', which points northward along the prime meridian. Along tight latitude circles, clockwise is east, and anti-clockwise is west, opposite to the North Pole. The Geographic South Pole is presently located on the continent of Antarctica, although this has not been the case for all of Earth's history because of continental drift. It sits atop a featureless, barren, windswept and icy plateau at an altitude of 2,835 m (9,301 ft) above sea level, and is located about 1,300 km (810 mi) from the nearest open sea at the Bay of Whales -"

"What's Bay of Whales?" a boy demanded excitedly.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The teacher noted, "The Bay of Whale -"

"What's Whale?" a student quizzed patiently.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The teacher seethed, "Wales (Welsh: Cymru [ˈkəm.rɨ] (listen)) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom -"

"What's United Kingdom?" a boy questioned calmly.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a nervous laugh.

The professor murmured happily, "The United Kingdom of Great Britain -"

"What's Kingdom of Great Britain?" a boy wondered slowly.

The educator acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The lecturer breathed sullenly, "The Kingdom of Great Britain -"

"What's Great Britain?" a pupil piped up mechanically.

The educator acknowledged the question with a grin.

The schoolteacher explained mechanically, "Great Britain is an island in the North Atlantic Ocean -"

The instructor took a breath, expecting a question from the class about Atlantic Ocean or some other topic.

The instructor continued.

The teacher muttered aggressively, "- Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe -"

The lecturer stopped, expecting a query from the students about Europe or some other topic.

The students listened in rapt attention.

The professor continued.

The educator seethed breathlessly, "- Europe. With an area of 209,331 km2 (80,823 sq mi), it is the largest of the British Isles -"

Issuing secular and non-secular degrees: grammar, rhetoric, logic, theology, canon law, notarial law. The original Latin word universitas refers in general to 'a number of persons associated into one body, a society, company, community, guild, corporation, etc'. At the time of the emergence of urban town life and medieval guilds, specialized 'associations of students and teachers with collective legal rights usually guaranteed by charters issued by princes, prelates, or the towns in which they were located' came to be denominated by this general term. Like other guilds, they were self-regulating and determined the qualifications of their members.In modern usage the word has come to mean 'An institution of higher education offering tuition in mainly non-vocational subjects and typically having the power to confer degrees,' with the earlier emphasis on its corporate organization considered as applying historically to Medieval universities.The original Latin word referred to degree-awarding institutions of learning in Western and Central Europe -"

Oddpost created an interface much like the traditional 3-pane view used by many desktop software applications (namely Microsoft Outlook, Apple's Mail, Microsoft Entourage, Mozilla Thunderbird, and others). Oddpost also had the design philosophy of making the interface invisible, where unread message headers were bolded, so there was no need for an unread message icon next to each message; sub folders were indented under the parent, so there was no need for a little ant trail connecting each folder. This excerpt from a 2003 interview with Ethan Diamond, Oddpost's co-founder and then president, explained this minimalist approach: This data-centric approach may sound painfully obvious, but consider that at 1024×768 (the most common resolution on the web), only about 30% of Yahoo! -"

Some disadvantages of Oddpost were seen to be that it required Windows and Internet Explorer, and that it lacked mail filters and support for secure email.Oddpost was purchased by Yahoo! on July 9, 2004, and became the new version of their Yahoo! Mail service. On September 14, 2005, Yahoo! Mail started letting some users register to beta test the new Yahoo! Mail web client.

The professor muttered patiently, "Austrogomphus australis, also known as Austrogomphus (Austrogomphus) -"

The teacher stopped, expecting a query from the pupils about Austrogomphus (Austrogomphus) or some other topic.

The students stifled their yawns.

The professor carried on.

The professor noted quietly, "- Austrogomphus (Austrogomphus) australis, is a species of dragonfly of the family Gomphidae -"

"What's Gomphidae?" a girl piped up gently.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a grin.

The educator explained carefully, "The Gomphidae are a family of dragonflies commonly referred to as clubtails or club-tailed dragonflies. The family contains about 90 genera and 900 species found across North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. The name refers to the club-like widening of the end of the abdomen (abdominal segments 7 through 9). However, this club is usually less pronounced in females and is entirely absent in some species. The name may be derived from Latin gomphus or gond meaning 'hinge'. Clubtails have small, widely separated compound eyes, a trait they share with the Petaluridae -"

The educator paused, listening for a question from the class about Petaluridae or some other topic.

The pupils stifled their yawns.

The teacher continued.

The professor murmured robotically, "- Petaluridae and with damselflies. The eyes are blue, turquoise, or green. The thorax in most species is pale with dark stripes, and the pattern of the stripes is often diagnostic. They lack the bright metallic colors of many dragonfly groups and are mostly cryptically colored to avoid detection and little difference between the sexes is seen. Adults are usually from 40 to 70 mm (1.6 to 2.8 in) in length; there are 6 specific variations that are native to Africa alone, and vary from 33 to 40 mm (1.3 to 1.6 in) in length; there are also 97 varieties specific to North America as well|url=http://cfb.unh.edu/StreamKey/html/organisms/OOdonata -"

"What's Odonata?" a boy asked sullenly.

The professor acknowledged the query with a nervous laugh.

The schoolteacher sang slowly, "Odonata is an order of flying insects that includes the dragonflies and damselflies. Like most other flying insects (flies, beetles, Lepidoptera -"

"What's Lepidoptera?" a student queried mechanically.

The schoolteacher paid no attention to the interruption and continued.

The instructor declared furiously, "- Lepidoptera, and Hymenoptera), they evolved in the early Mesozoic era. Their prototypes, the giant dragonflies of the Carboniferous -"

"What's Carboniferous?" a pupil quizzed politely.

The lecturer disregarded the interruption and proceeded.

The professor sang carefully, "- Carboniferous, 325 MYA, are no longer placed in the Odonata but included in the Protodonata -"

The professor noted furiously, "Lepidoptera ( lep-ih-DOP-tər-ə; from Ancient Greek λεπίδος (lepídos) 'scale', and πτερά (pterá) 'wings') is an order of insects that includes butterflies and moths (both are called lepidopterans). About 180,000 species of the Lepidoptera are described, in 126 families and 46 superfamilies, 10 percent of the total described species of living organisms. It is one of the most widespread and widely recognizable insect orders in the world. The Lepidoptera show many variations of the basic body structure that have evolved to gain advantages in lifestyle and distribution. Recent estimates suggest the order may have more species than earlier thought, and is among the four most speciose orders, along with the Hymenoptera -"

"What's Hymenoptera?" a girl piped up slowly.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The educator explained gingerly, "Hymenopt -"

The lecturer paused, waiting for a query from the class about Etymology or some other topic.

The class sniggered.

The lecturer carried on.

The instructor breathed gently, "- Triassic, Jurassic -"

"Who's Jurassic?" a student asked slowly.

The teacher ignored the interruption and continued.

The schoolteacher sang carefully, "- Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods. It is characterized by the dominance of archosaurian reptiles, like the dinosaurs; an abundance of conifers and ferns; a hot greenhouse climate; and the tectonic break-up of Pangaea -"

The professor paused, anticipating a query from the class about Pangaea or some other topic.

It inhabits streams and rivers in eastern Australia.Austrogomphus amphiclitus is a medium-sized, black and yellow dragonfly. List of Odonata species of Australia -"

"What's List of Odonata species of Australia?" a boy blurted happily.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a nod.

The professor announced gently, "This is a list of species of damselflies and dragonflies recorded in Australia -"

"What's Australia?" a student interjected excitedly.

The teacher ignored the interruption and proceeded.

The lecturer sang quickly, "- Australia. Common names of species are linked, beside their scientific names. The list is split into two groups: damselflies (suborder Zygoptera) and other dragonflies (infraorder Anisoptera -"

"Who's Anisoptera?" a pupil said carefully.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The schoolteacher seethed timidly, "A dragonfly is a flying insect belonging to the order Odonata -"

"Who's Odonata?" a boy queried gently.

The instructor carried on.

The educator elaborated carefully, "- Lepidoptera, and Hymenoptera -"

"What's Hymenoptera?" a girl said sullenly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the query with a grin.

The instructor announced breathlessly, "Hymenoptera is a large order of insects, comprising the sawflies, wasps, bees, and ants. Over 150,000 living species of Hymenoptera have been described, in addition to over 2,000 extinct ones. Many of the species are parasitic. Females typically have a special ovipositor for inserting eggs into hosts or places that are otherwise inaccessible. This ovipositor is often modified into a stinger. The young develop through holometabolism (complete metamorphosis)—that is, they have a wormlike larval stage and an inactive pupal stage before they mature. The name Hymenoptera refers to the wings of the insects, but the original derivation is ambiguous.: 42 All references agree that the derivation involves the Ancient Greek πτερόν (pteron) for wing. The Ancient Greek ὑμήν (hymen) for membrane provides a plausible etymology for the term because species in this order have membranous wings. However, a key characteristic of this order is that the hindwings are connected to the forewings by a series of hooks. Thus, another plausible etymology involves Hymen, the Ancient Greek god of marriage, as these insects have married wings in flight. A story from Ancient Greek mythology is a potential origin for the name, whereby it is not the insects' wings that are married, but Zeus and Hera. The first wedding ever to take place required a fitting dish; Zeus announced that the creature who made the most delicious food for the occasion could ask of him any favour. All the creatures throughout the land made and brought their own food and Zeus and Hera tried every dish. The chosen food, to become the nectar of the gods, was honey - brought by the first bee, Melissa. To this day the order of insects are known as Wedding Wings (Ancient Greek: hymenoptera). The cladogram of external relationships, based on a 2008 DNA -"

"What's DNA?" a girl demanded crudely.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The educator ignored the interruption and carried on.

The educator seethed politely, "- DNA and protein analysis, shows the order as a clade, most closely related to endopterygote orders including the Diptera -"

The professor took a breath, expecting a question from the class about Diptera or some other topic.

The educator continued.

The schoolteacher breathed quickly, "- Diptera (true flies) and Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). Hymenoptera originated in the Triassic -"

"What's Triassic?" a girl asked breathlessly.

The lecturer disregarded the interruption and continued.

The lecturer announced carefully, "- Triassic, with the oldest fossils belonging to the family Xyelidae -"

"What's Xyelidae?" a pupil blurted gently.

The educator acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The instructor seethed robotically, "The Xyelidae are a comparatively species-poor family of sawflies comprising about 80 extant species in five genera worldwide and is the only family in the superfamily Xyeloidea. The fossil record of the family is extensive, comprising more than 120 species and including the oldest fossil Hymenoptera -"

The educator announced crudely, "- Triassic Period 201.3 million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Cretaceous -"

"Who's Cretaceous?" a pupil queried patiently.

The instructor acknowledged the question with a smirk.

The lecturer murmured confidently, "The Cretaceous ( krə-TAY-shəs) is a geological period that lasted from about 145 to 66 million years ago (Mya). It is the third and final period of the Mesozoic -"

"What's Mesozoic?" a girl wondered furiously.

The schoolteacher elaborated happily, "The Mesozoic Era ( mez-ə-ZOH-ik, mez-oh-, mess-, mee-zə-, -⁠zoh-, mee-sə-, -⁠soh-), also called the Age of Reptile -"

"What's Reptile?" a girl questioned excitedly.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a nod.

The professor explained pointedly, "Reptiles, as most commonly defined, are the animals in the class Reptilia , a paraphyletic grouping comprising all amniotes except synapsids (mammals and their extinct relatives) and Aves (birds). The class comprises turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. In the traditional Linnaean classification system, birds are considered a separate class to reptiles. However, crocodilians are more closely related to birds than they are to other living reptiles, and so modern cladistic classification systems include birds within Reptilia, redefining the term as a clade. Other cladistic definitions abandon the term reptile altogether in favor of the clade Sauropsida, which refers to all animals more closely related to modern reptiles than to mammals. The study of the traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology. The earliest known proto-reptiles originated around 312 million years ago during the Carboniferous -"

"What's Carboniferous?" a student questioned aggressively.

The teacher ignored the interruption and carried on.

"What's Romance languages?" a boy piped up gingerly.

The educator ignored the interruption and proceeded.

The schoolteacher muttered politely, "- Romance languages (ouest in French, oest in Catalan, ovest in Italian, oeste in Spanish and Portuguese). As in other languages, the word formation stems from the fact that west is the direction of the setting sun in the evening: 'west' derives from the Indo-European root *wes reduced from *wes-pero 'evening, night', cognate with Ancient Greek ἕσπερος hesperos 'evening; evening star; western' and Latin vesper 'evening; west'. Examples of the same formation in other languages include Latin occidens 'west' from occidō 'to go down, to set' and Hebrew מַעֲרָב maarav 'west' from עֶרֶב erev 'evening'.

The lecturer seethed crudely, "China (Chinese: 中国; pinyin: Zhōngguó), officially the People's Republic of China -"

"What's Republic of China?" a student blurted happily.

The schoolteacher disregarded the interruption and proceeded.

The professor murmured furiously, "- Republic of China (PRC; Chinese: 中华人民共和国; pinyin: Zhōnghuá Rénmín Gònghéguó), is a country in East Asia.

The instructor stopped, expecting a query from the students about Europe or some other topic.

The instructor carried on.

The schoolteacher muttered gently, "Russia (Russian: Россия, Rossiya, Russian pronunciation: [rɐˈsʲijə]), or the Russian Federation -"

"What's Federation?" a pupil asked robotically.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The professor explained slowly, "A federation (also known as a federal state) is a political entity characterized by a union of partially self-governing provinces, states, or other regions under a central federal government (federalism). In a federation, the self-governing status of the component states, as well as the division of power between them and the central government, is typically constitutionally entrenched and may not be altered by a unilateral decision of either party, the states or the federal political body. Alternatively, a federation is a form of government in which sovereign power is formally divided between a central authority and a number of constituent regions so that each region retains some degree of control over its internal affairs. It is often argued that federal states where the central government has overriding powers are not truly federal states. For example, such overriding powers may include: the constitutional authority to suspend a constituent state's government by invoking gross mismanagement or civil unrest, or to adopt national legislation that overrides or infringes on the constituent states' powers by invoking the central government's constitutional authority to ensure 'peace and good government' or to implement obligations contracted under an international treaty. The governmental or constitutional structure found in a federation is considered to be federalist, or to be an example of federalism. It can be considered the opposite of another system, the unitary state. France -"

The educator stopped, expecting a query from the students about France or some other topic.

The pupils sniggered.

The lecturer carried on.

"Alright, returning to Russia....", the lecturer announced.

The class sniggered.

"So, turning back our attention to Russians....", the instructor muttered crudely.

The class stifled their yawns.

"Alright, turning back our attention to Russia....", the professor announced timidly.

"Now then, getting back to Man....", the educator murmured breathlessly.

The students stifled their yawns.

"Now, getting back to Kaidun meteorite....", the professor muttered gingerly.

The pupils sniggered.

The schoolteacher elaborated calmly, "- Yemen. A fireball was observed travelling from the northwest to the southeast, and a single stone weighing about 2 kilograms (4.4 lb) was recovered from a small impact pit. It contains a uniquely wide variety of minerals, causing debate about its origin. It is largely carbonaceous chondrite material of type CR2, but also contains fragments of other types, such as C1, CM1, and C3. Of the nearly 60 minerals found in the meteorite, several have not been found elsewhere in nature, such as florenskyite, which has the chemical formula FeTiP. In March 2004 it was suggested that the meteorite originated from the Martian -"

The schoolteacher halted, listening for a question from the students about Martian or some other topic.

The professor proceeded.

The instructor murmured mechanically, "- Martian moon Phobos. The reason Phobos has been suggested is the existence of two extremely rare alkaline-rich clasts visible in the meteorite, each of which entered the rock at different times. This suggests that the parent body would have been near a source of an alkaline-rich rock, which is almost wholly produced by deep differentiation. This points to Mars -"

"What's Mars?" a girl piped up gently.

The professor acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The lecturer said breathlessly, "Mar (from Classical Syriac: ܡܪܝ‎ Mār(y), written with a silent final yodh) or Mor (vernacular pronunciation) is a title of respect in Syriac, literally meaning 'my lord'. It is given to all saints and is also used before Christian name of bishops. The corresponding feminine form given to women saints is Marth or Morth (Syriac: ܡܪܬܝ‎, Mārt(y)).

"What's Latin?" a pupil said calmly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a smile.

The professor explained calmly, "Latin (latīnum, [laˈt̪iːnʊ̃] or lingua latīna, [ˈlɪŋɡʷa laˈt̪iːna]) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages -"

"What's Indo-European languages?" a girl piped up robotically.

The instructor disregarded the interruption and proceeded.

The educator muttered sadly, "- Indo-European languages. Latin was originally spoken in the area around Rome -"

"What's Rome?" a student demanded breathlessly.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The teacher paid no attention to the interruption and continued.

The schoolteacher seethed aggressively, "- Rome, known as Latium. Through the power of the Roman Republic -"

"What's Roman Republic?" a boy wondered happily.

The educator acknowledged the question with a nod.

The instructor muttered gingerly, "The Roman Republic -"

"What's Republic?" a girl asked politely.

The educator acknowledged the query with a nervous laugh.

The educator muttered calmly, "A republic (from Latin res publica 'public affair') is a form of government in which 'power is held by the people and their elected representatives'. In republics, the country is considered a 'public matter', not the private concern or property of the rulers. The primary positions of power within a republic are attained through democracy or a mix of democracy with oligarchy or autocracy rather than being unalterably occupied by any given family lineage or group. With modern republicanism, it has become the opposing form of government to a monarchy and therefore a modern republic has no monarch as head of state.As of 2017, 159 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word 'republic' as part of their official names. Not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor is the word 'republic' used in the names of all states with elected governments. The word republic comes from the Latin term res publica, which literally means 'public thing', 'public matter', or 'public affair' and was used to refer to the state as a whole. The term developed its modern meaning in reference to the constitution of the ancient Roman Republic -"

The teacher looked around, anticipating a query from the pupils about Roman Republic or some other topic.

The students sniggered.

The instructor continued.

The teacher muttered, "- Roman Republic, lasting from the overthrow of the kings in 509 BC to the establishment of the Empire in 27 BC. This constitution was characterized by a Senate composed of wealthy aristocrats wielding significant influence; several popular assemblies of all free citizens, possessing the power to elect magistrates and pass laws; and a series of magistracies with varying types of civil and political authority. Most often a republic is a single sovereign state, but there are also sub-sovereign state entities that are referred to as republics, or that have governments that are described as republican in nature. For instance, the United States -"

"What's United States?" a girl blurted breathlessly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a nervous laugh.

The teacher explained politely, "The United States of America -"

"What's America?" a girl blurted furiously.

The professor acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The lecturer said politely, "The United States of America -"

"What's The United States of America?" a pupil demanded gently.

The educator ignored the interruption and continued.

The lecturer murmured sullenly, "- The United States of America -"

"What's America?" a pupil queried.

The professor paid no heed to the interruption and carried on.

The professor seethed happily, "- America (U.S.A. or USA -"

"What's USA?" a boy interjected gently.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a nod.

The schoolteacher paid no attention to the interruption and continued.

The lecturer said quietly, "- USA), commonly known as the United States (U.S. or US) or America, is a country primarily located in North America. It consists of 50 states, a federal district, five major unincorporated territories, 326 Indian reservation -"

"What's Indian reservation?" a pupil queried crudely.

The teacher ignored the interruption and proceeded.

The educator sang pointedly, "- Indian reservations -"

The instructor took a breath, listening for a question from the pupils about Indian reservations or some other topic.

The teacher proceeded.

The schoolteacher noted excitedly, "- Indian reservations, and some minor possessions. At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million square kilometers), it is the world's third- or fourth-largest country by total area. The United States shares significant land borders with Canada to the north and Mexico -"

"What's Mexico?" a student quizzed quickly.

The educator acknowledged the question with a nervous laugh.

The schoolteacher muttered happily, "Mexico, officially the United Mexican States -"

"What's United Mexican States?" a student said quietly.

The professor disregarded the interruption and carried on.

The instructor announced sullenly, "- United Mexica -"

"What's Mexica?" a student said gently.

The professor acknowledged the question with a nervous laugh.

The schoolteacher said confidently, "Mexico, officially the United Mexican States -"

"What's United Mexican States?" a student quizzed quietly.

"Alright, turning back our attention to Mexico....", the professor declared quietly.

The schoolteacher muttered, "A castle is a type of fortified structure built during the Middle Ages -"

The educator halted, expecting a question from the pupils about Middle Ages or some other topic.

The students listened in rapt attention.

The professor continued.

The teacher said gently, "- Middle Ages predominantly by the nobility or royalty and by military orders. Scholars debate the scope of the word castle, but usually consider it to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble. This is distinct from a palace, which is not fortified; from a fortress, which was not always a residence for royalty or nobility; from a ‘pleasance’ which was a walled-in residence for nobility, but not adequately fortified; and from a fortified settlement, which was a public defence – though there are many similarities among these types of construction. Use of the term has varied over time and has been applied to structures as diverse as hill forts and country houses. Over the approximately 900 years that castles were built, they took on a great many forms with many different features, although some, such as curtain walls, arrowslits, and portcullises, were commonplace. Europe -"

The instructor sang slowly, "The Northern Hemisphere is the half of the Earth that is north of the Equator -"

"What's Equator?" a student interjected quietly.

The instructor paid no attention to the interruption and continued.

The schoolteacher sang robotically, "- Equator. For other planets in the Solar System -"

"What's Solar System?" a boy wondered sullenly.

The professor disregarded the interruption and continued.

The educator explained timidly, "- Solar System, north is defined as being in the same celestial hemisphere relative to the invariable plane of the solar system as Earth's North Pole.Owing to the Earth's axial tilt of 23.439281°, winter in the Northern Hemisphere lasts from the December solstice (typically December 21 UTC) to the March equinox (typically March 20 UTC), while summer lasts from the June solstice through to the September equinox (typically on 23 September UTC). The dates vary each year due to the difference between the calendar year and the astronomical year. Within the northern hemisphere, oceanic currents can change the weather patterns that affect many factors within the north coast. Such events include ENSO (El Niño-Southern Oscillation). Trade winds blow from east to west just above the equator. The winds pull surface water with them, creating currents, which flow westward due to the Coriolis effect -"

"What's Coriolis effect?" a student asked sullenly.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a nod.

The teacher elaborated calmly, "In physics, the Coriolis force is an inertial or fictitious force that acts on objects that are in motion within a frame of reference that rotates with respect to an inertial frame. In a reference frame with clockwise rotation, the force acts to the left of the motion of the object. In one with anticlockwise (or counterclockwise) rotation, the force acts to the right. Deflection of an object due to the Coriolis force is called the Coriolis effect -"

"What's Coriolis effect?" a boy demanded patiently.

The educator acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The instructor noted patiently, "In physics, the Coriolis force is an inertial or fictitious force that acts on objects that are in motion within a frame of reference that rotates with respect to an inertial frame. In a reference frame with clockwise rotation, the force acts to the left of the motion of the object. In one with anticlockwise (or counterclockwise) rotation, the force acts to the right. Deflection of an object due to the Coriolis force is called the Coriolis effect. Though recognized previously by others, the mathematical expression for the Coriolis force appeared in an 1835 paper by French scientist Gaspard-Gustave de Coriolis -"

The instructor took a breath, expecting a question from the class about Gaspard-Gustave de Coriolis or some other topic.

The students watched quietly.

The professor carried on.

The instructor declared timidly, "- Gaspard-Gustave de Coriolis, in connection with the theory of water wheels. Early in the 20th century, the term Coriolis force began to be used in connection with meteorology. Newton's laws of motion -"

"What's Newton's laws of motion?" a pupil asked mechanically.

The schoolteacher halted, expecting a question from the pupils about Purchase, New York or some other topic.

The students listened in rapt attention.

The schoolteacher carried on.

The instructor elaborated pointedly, "- Purchase, New York. Founded in 1841 at 412 Houston Street -"

"What's Houston Street?" a student said calmly.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The schoolteacher breathed politely, "Houston -"

"Who's Houston?" a girl asked slowly.

The educator disregarded the interruption and carried on.

The students stifled their yawns.

The schoolteacher proceeded.

The schoolteacher murmured pointedly, "- Manhattan, also known as Downtown -"

It is marked by a cluster of tall buildings, cultural institutions and the convergence of rail transit and bus lines. In British English, the term 'city centre' is most often used instead. The Oxford English Dictionary -"

The schoolteacher halted, waiting for a query from the students about Oxford English Dictionary or some other topic.

The class listened in rapt attention.

The instructor continued.

The lecturer murmured timidly, "- Oxford English Dictionary's first citation for 'down town' or 'downtown' dates to 1770, in reference to the center of Boston. Some have posited that the term 'downtown' was coined in New York City -"

"What's New York City?" a pupil blurted gently.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a smile.

The lecturer paid no attention to the interruption and proceeded.

The lecturer seethed timidly, "- New York City, where it was in use by the 1830s to refer to the original town at the southern tip of the island of Manhattan -"

"What's Manhattan?" a boy interjected slowly.

The lecturer disregarded the interruption and proceeded.

The educator announced confidently, "- Manhattan. As the town of New York grew into a city, the only direction it could grow on the island was toward the north, proceeding upriver from the original settlement, the 'up' and 'down' terminology coming from the customary map design in which up was north and down was south. Thus, anything north of the original town became known as 'uptown' (Upper Manhattan -"

The instructor looked around, anticipating a query from the pupils about Upper Manhattan or some other topic.

The students sat straighter in their seats.

The lecturer carried on.

The professor seethed excitedly, "- Upper Manhattan), and was generally a residential area, while the original town – which was also New York's only major center of business at the time – became known as 'downtown' (Lower Manhattan). During the late 19th century, the term was gradually adopted by cities across the United States -"

Animators can work in a variety of fields including film, television, and video games. Animation is closely related to filmmaking and like filmmaking is extremely labor-intensive, which means that most significant works require the collaboration of several animators. The methods of creating the images or frames for an animation piece depend on the animators' artistic styles and their field. Other artists who contribute to animated cartoons, but who are not animators, include layout artists (who design the backgrounds, lighting, and camera angles), storyboard artists (who draw panels of the action from the script), and background artists (who paint the 'scenery'). Animated films share some film crew positions with regular live action films, such as director, producer, sound engineer, and editor, but differ radically in that for most of the history of animation, they did not need most of the crew positions seen on a physical set.

The lecturer sang furiously, "A republic (from Latin res publica 'public affair') is a form of government in which 'power is held by the people and their elected representatives'. In republics, the country is considered a 'public matter', not the private concern or property of the rulers. The primary positions of power within a republic are attained through democracy or a mix of democracy with oligarchy or autocracy rather than being unalterably occupied by any given family lineage or group. With modern republicanism, it has become the opposing form of government to a monarchy and therefore a modern republic has no monarch as head of state.As of 2017, 159 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word 'republic' as part of their official names. Not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor is the word 'republic' used in the names of all states with elected governments. The word republic comes from the Latin term res publica, which literally means 'public thing', 'public matter', or 'public affair' and was used to refer to the state as a whole. The term developed its modern meaning in reference to the constitution of the ancient Roman Republic -"

The professor paused, anticipating a question from the pupils about Roman Republic or some other topic.

Most often a republic is a single sovereign state, but there are also sub-sovereign state entities that are referred to as republics, or that have governments that are described as republican in nature. For instance, the United States Constitution -"

"What's United States Constitution?" a student raised gingerly.

The professor acknowledged the question with a nod.

The instructor announced carefully, "- International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is independent. According to the declarative theory of statehood, a sovereign state can exist without being recognised by other sovereign states. Unrecognised states will often find it difficult to exercise full treaty-making powers or engage in diplomatic relations with other sovereign states. Since the end of the 19th century, almost the entire globe has been divided into sections (countries) with more or less defined borders assigned to different states. Previously, quite large plots of land were either unclaimed or deserted, or inhabited nomadic peoples that were not organized into states. However, even in modern states, there are large remote areas, such as the Amazon's tropical forests, that are either uninhabited or inhabited exclusively or mainly by indigenous people (and some of them are still not in constant contact). There are also States that do not exercise de facto control over their entire territory, or where this control is disputed. Currently, the international community includes more than 200 sovereign states, most of which are represented in the United Nations -"

The professor took a breath, anticipating a query from the pupils about United Nations or some other topic.

From this point of view, States are integrated into the international system of special internal and external security and legitimization of the dilemma. Recently, the concept of the international community has been formed to refer to a group of States that have established rules, procedures and institutions for the implementation of relations. Thus, the foundation for international law, diplomacy between officially recognized sovereign states, their organizations and formal regimes has been laid. Westphalian sovereignty is the concept of nation-state sovereignty based on territoriality and the absence of a role for external agents in domestic structures. It is an international system of states, multinational corporations, and organizations that began with the Peace of Westphalia -"

"What's Peace of Westphalia?" a girl raised carefully.

The schoolteacher paid no attention to the interruption and continued.

The schoolteacher said sullenly, "- Peace of Westphalia in 1648. Sovereignty -"

"Who's Sovereignty?" a boy blurted happily.

The schoolteacher ignored the interruption and proceeded.

The lecturer announced breathlessly, "- Sovereignty is a term that is frequently misused. Up until the 19th century, the radicalised concept of a 'standard of civilization' was routinely deployed to determine that certain people in the world were 'uncivilized', and lacking organised societies. That position was reflected and constituted in the notion that their 'sovereignty' was either completely lacking or at least of an inferior character when compared to that of the 'civilized' people.' Lassa Oppenheim -"

"What's Sea?" a student raised calmly.

The professor acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The instructor paid no heed to the interruption and proceeded.

The schoolteacher murmured confidently, "- Seawater, or salt water, is water from a sea or ocean. On average, seawater in the world's oceans has a salinity of about 3.5% (35 g/l, 35 ppt, 600 mM). This means that every kilogram (roughly one liter by volume) of seawater has approximately 35 grams (1.2 oz) of dissolved salts (predominantly sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl−) ions). Average density at the surface is 1.025 kg/l. Seawater is denser than both fresh water and pure water (density 1.0 kg/l at 4 °C (39 °F)) because the dissolved salts increase the mass by a larger proportion than the volume. In comparison, most human physiological saline levels are approximately one quarter of this, for example blood is 9g/l (0.9% w/v). The freezing point of seawater decreases as salt concentration increases. At typical salinity, it freezes at about −2 °C (28 °F). The coldest seawater still in the liquid state ever recorded was found in 2010, in a stream under an Antarctic -"

The instructor sang mechanically, "The Gulf of Aden -"

"What's Aden?" a boy raised slowly.

The instructor acknowledged the question with a smile.

The lecturer breathed furiously, "In common usage and in philosophy, ideas are abstract concepts. Also in philosophy, ideas can also be mental representational images of some object. Man -"

The educator took a breath, waiting for a query from the class about Man or some other topic.

The instructor carried on.

The professor seethed carefully, "- Many philosophers have considered ideas to be a fundamental ontological category of being. The capacity to create and understand the meaning of ideas is considered to be an essential and defining feature of human beings. In a popular sense, an idea arises in a reflexive, spontaneous manner, even without thinking or serious reflection, for example, when we talk about the idea of a person or a place. A new or an original idea can often lead to innovation. The word idea comes from Greek ἰδέα idea 'form, pattern,' from the root of ἰδεῖν idein, 'to see.' One view on the nature of ideas is that there exist some ideas (called innate ideas) which can be general and abstract that they could not have arisen as a representation of an object of our perception but rather were in some sense always present. These are distinguished from adventitious ideas which are images or concepts which are accompanied by the judgment that they are caused or occasioned by an external object.Another view holds that we only discover ideas in the same way that we discover the real world, from personal experiences. The view that humans acquire all or almost all their behavioral traits from nurture (life experiences) is known as tabula rasa ('blank slate'). Most of the confusions in the way ideas arise is at least in part due to the use of the term 'idea' to cover both the representation perceptics and the object of conceptual thought. This can be always illustrated in terms of the scientific doctrines of innate ideas, 'concrete ideas versus abstract ideas', as well as 'simple ideas versus complex ideas'. Plato in Ancient Greece was one of the earliest philosophers to provide a detailed discussion of ideas and of the thinking process (in Plato's Greek the word idea carries a rather different sense from our modern English term). Plato argued in dialogues such as the Phaedo, Symposium, Republic, and Timaeus that there is a realm of ideas or forms (eidei), which exist independently of anyone who may have thoughts on these ideas, and it is the ideas which distinguish mere opinion from knowledge, for unlike material things which are transient and liable to contrary properties, ideas are unchanging and nothing but just what they are. Consequently, Plato seems to assert forcefully that material things can only be the objects of opinion; real knowledge can only be had of unchanging ideas. Furthermore, ideas for Plato appear to serve as universals; consider the following passage from the Republic: 'We both assert that there are,' I said, 'and distinguish in speech, many fair things, many good things, and so on for each kind of thing.' 'Yes, so we do.' 'And we also assert that there is a fair itself, a good itself, and so on for all things that we set down as many. Now, again, we refer to them as one idea of each as though the idea were one; and we address it as that which really is.' 'That's so.' 'And, moreover, we say that the former are seen, but not intellected, while the ideas are intellected but not seen.' Descartes often wrote of the meaning of idea as an image or representation, often but not necessarily 'in the mind', which was well known in the vernacular. Despite that Descartes is usually credited with the invention of the non-Platonic use of the term, he at first followed this vernacular use.b In his Meditations on First Philosophy -"

"What's Philosophy?" a girl questioned quickly.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The lecturer noted excitedly, "Philosophy (from Greek: φιλοσοφία, philosophia, 'love of wisdom') is the study of general and fundamental questions, such as those about existence, reason, knowledge, values, mind, and language. Such questions are often posed as problems to be studied or resolved. Some sources claim the term was coined by Pythagoras -"

"Who's Pythagoras?" a pupil blurted robotically.

The professor acknowledged the question with a grin.

The lecturer paid no heed to the interruption and continued.

The instructor seethed pointedly, "- Pythagoras (c. 570 – c. 495 BCE); others dispute this story, arguing that Pythagoreans merely claimed use of a preexisting term. Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument, and systematic presentation.Historically, philosophy encompassed all bodies of knowledge and a practitioner was known as a philosopher. From the time of Ancient Greek -"

"What's Ancient Greek?" a boy piped up politely.

The instructor acknowledged the question with a smile.

The instructor sang excitedly, "Ancient Greek includes the forms of the Greek language -"

"What's Greek language?" a student queried crudely.

The educator ignored the interruption and carried on.

The professor seethed happily, "- Greek language used in ancient Greece -"

"What's Greece?" a pupil demanded sadly.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a smile.

The schoolteacher murmured crudely, "Green is the color between blue and yellow on the visible spectrum. It is evoked by light which has a dominant wavelength of roughly 495–570 nm. In subtractive color systems, used in painting and color printing, it is created by a combination of yellow and cyan; in the RGB color model -"

"What's RGB color model?" a girl questioned slowly.

The educator acknowledged the question with a grin.

The schoolteacher seethed excitedly, "The RGB color model is an additive color model in which the red, green, and blue primary colors of light are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors. The name of the model comes from the initials of the three additive primary colors, red, green, and blue. The main purpose of the RGB color model is for the sensing, representation, and display of images in electronic systems, such as televisions and computers, though it has also been used in conventional photography. Before the electronic age, the RGB color model already had a solid theory behind it, based in human perception of colors. RGB is a device-dependent color model: different devices detect or reproduce a given RGB value differently, since the color elements (such as phosphors or dyes) and their response to the individual red, green, and blue levels vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, or even in the same device over time. Thus an RGB value does not define the same color across devices without some kind of color management. Typical RGB input devices are color TV and video cameras, image scanners, and digital cameras. Typical RGB output devices are TV sets of various technologies (CRT, LCD, plasma, OLED -"

The lecturer took a breath, expecting a question from the class about OLED or some other topic.

The professor acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The lecturer breathed excitedly, "Romanization or romanisation, in linguistics, is the conversion of text from a different writing system to the Roman (Latin) script, or a system for doing so. Methods of romanization include transliteration, for representing written text, and transcription, for representing the spoken word, and combinations of both. Transcription methods can be subdivided into phonemic transcription, which records the phonemes or units of semantic meaning in speech, and more strict phonetic transcription, which records speech sounds with precision. There are many consistent or standardized romanization systems. They can be classified by their characteristics. A particular system’s characteristics may make it better-suited for various, sometimes contradictory applications, including document retrieval, linguistic analysis, easy readability, faithful representation of pronunciation. Source, or donor language – A system may be tailored to romanize text from a particular language, or a series of languages, or for any language in a particular writing system. A language-specific system typically preserves language features like pronunciation, while the general one may be better for cataloguing international texts. Target, or receiver language – Most systems are intended for an audience that speaks or reads a particular language. (So-called international romanization systems for Cyrillic text are based on central-European alphabets like the Czech and Croatian alphabet.) Simplicity – Since the basic Latin alphabet has a smaller number of letters than many other writing systems, digraphs, diacritics, or special characters must be used to represent them all in Latin script -"

"What's Latin script?" a boy quizzed confidently.

The lecturer paid no heed to the interruption and carried on.

The educator murmured carefully, "- ISO -"

"What's ISO?" a pupil quizzed pointedly.

The lecturer paid no heed to the interruption and proceeded.

"So, returning to E....", the instructor murmured gently.

The class suppressed giggles.

"Now, going back to R....", the instructor murmured happily.

The class sniggered.

"Now, going back to Latin script....", the instructor murmured sullenly.

The class watched quietly.

"Alright, back again to Romanization....", the lecturer declared mechanically.

The pupils suppressed giggles.

"Now, back again to Kojur....", the educator announced robotically.

The class suppressed giggles.

"Well then, going back to Nowshahr County....", the schoolteacher noted happily.

The students stifled their yawns.

# Lesson 26: Starbenders

"Greetings, class! Today we'll be learning about Starbenders," the teacher breathed sadly.

The class sat straighter in their seats.

The schoolteacher noted breathlessly, "Starbenders are an American rock band from the suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia. The group was formed in 2013 when lead singer and guitarist Kimi Shelter contacted her former bandmate Aaron Lecesne about doing a new project. After adding guitarist Kriss Tokaji and drummer Emily Moon, Starbenders were subsequently signed to former Lady Gaga -"

"Who's Lady Gaga?" a girl queried aggressively.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a smile.

The educator paid no heed to the interruption and carried on.

The instructor explained patiently, "- Lady Gaga music director/guitarist Nico Constantine -"

"Who's Nico Constantine?" a pupil said pointedly.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a nod.

The instructor noted politely, "Nico Constantine is an American music director, producer, and guitarist, known for his work with Lady Gaga -"

The instructor stopped, anticipating a query from the students about Lady Gaga or some other topic.

The pupils listened in rapt attention.

The instructor carried on.

The schoolteacher muttered gently, "- Lady Gaga, Biters, Program the Dead, Comes with the Fall, and Madfly. He is the founder of Institution Records. In 1996, Constantine joined Madfly in Atlanta, Georgia -"

"What's Atlanta, Georgia?" a boy interjected crudely.

The teacher disregarded the interruption and continued.

The lecturer noted timidly, "- Atlanta, Georgia, along with singer-guitarist William DuVall, drummer Bevan Davies, and bassist Jeffery Blount. In 1998, Joan Jett signed Madfly to Blackheart/Mercury Records. After releasing White Hot in the Black, the band left Blackheart/Mercury, and reformed as Comes with the Fall in 1999, with Adam Stanger -"

"Who's Adam Stanger?" a pupil quizzed patiently.

The professor paid no attention to the interruption and proceeded.

The teacher breathed excitedly, "- Adam Stanger replacing Jeffery Blount on bass.Comes with the Fall recorded their self-titled album in Atlanta, a year later, before relocating to Los Angeles, California, catching the attention of Alice in Chains -"

The educator stopped, expecting a question from the class about Alice in Chains or some other topic.

The students sniggered.

The schoolteacher proceeded.

The lecturer noted mechanically, "- Alice in Chains guitarist Jerry Cantrell -"

"Who's Jerry Cantrell?" a girl said excitedly.

The professor acknowledged the query with a nod.

The lecturer murmured patiently, "Jerry Fulton Cantrell Jr. (born March 18, 1966) is an American guitarist, singer and songwriter. He is best known as the founder, lead guitarist, co-lead vocalist, and main songwriter of rock band Alice in Chains -"

"What's Alice in Chains?" a girl blurted excitedly.

The lecturer paid no heed to the interruption and proceeded.

The educator declared quickly, "- Alice in Chains. The band rose to international fame in the early 1990s during Seattle -"

"What's Seattle?" a girl piped up politely.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a smile.

The schoolteacher elaborated pointedly, "Seattle ( (listen) see-AT-əl) is a seaport city on the West Coast of the United States -"

"What's West Coast of the United States?" a pupil demanded politely.

The professor acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The schoolteacher murmured patiently, "The West Coast -"

"What's The West Coast?" a pupil asked aggressively.

The instructor acknowledged the question with a nervous laugh.

The professor announced breathlessly, "The West Coast -"

"What's The West Coast?" a pupil asked happily.

The educator paid no heed to the interruption and proceeded.

The instructor muttered pointedly, "- The West Coast -"

"What's Coast?" a pupil wondered quickly.

The professor acknowledged the query with a smile.

The professor explained happily, "A court is any person or institution, often as a government institution, with the authority to adjudicate legal disputes between parties and carry out the administration of justice in civil, criminal, and administrative matters in accordance with the rule of law. In both common law and civil law legal systems, courts are the central means for dispute resolution, and it is generally understood that all people have an ability to bring their claims before a court. Similarly, the rights of those accused of a crime include the right to present a defense before a court. The system of courts that interprets and applies the law is collectively known as the judiciary. The place where a court sits is known as a venue. The room where court proceedings occur is known as a courtroom, and the building as a courthouse; court facilities range from simple and very small facilities in rural communities to large buildings in cities. The practical authority given to the court is known as its jurisdiction (from Latin iūrisdictiō, from iūris, 'of the law,' + dīcō, 'to declare,' + -tiō, noun-forming suffix), the court's power to decide certain kinds of questions or petitions put to it. According to William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England -"

"What's Commentaries on the Laws of England?" a girl said calmly.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a smile.

The teacher murmured patiently, "The Commentaries on the Laws of England are an influential 18th-century treatise on the common law of England by Sir William Blackstone, originally published by the Clarendon Press at Oxford -"

The teacher stopped, expecting a query from the class about Oxford or some other topic.

The class sat straighter in their seats.

The teacher proceeded.

The instructor said quickly, "- Oxford, 1765–1770. The work is divided into four volumes, on the rights of persons, the rights of things, of private wrongs and of public wrongs. The Commentaries were long regarded as the leading work on the development of English law and played a role in the development of the American legal system. They were in fact the first methodical treatise on the common law suitable for a lay readership since at least the Middle Ages. The common law of England has relied on precedent more than statute and codifications and has been far less amenable than the civil law, developed from the Roman law -"

"What's Roman law?" a student said aggressively.

The lecturer disregarded the interruption and continued.

The professor murmured gently, "- Roman law, to the needs of a treatise. The Commentaries were influential largely because they were in fact readable, and because they met a need. The Commentaries are often quoted as the definitive pre-Revolutionary source of common law by United States courts. Opinions of the Supreme Court of the United States quote from Blackstone's work whenever they wish to engage in historical discussion that goes back that far, or farther (for example, when discussing the intent of the Framers of the Constitution). The book was famously used as the key in Benedict Arnold's book cipher, which he used to communicate secretly with his conspirator John André -"

"Who's John André?" a pupil blurted crudely.

The instructor paid no attention to the interruption and carried on.

The lecturer announced patiently, "- John André during their plot to betray the Continental Army -"

"What's Continental Army?" a pupil interjected furiously.

The instructor acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The lecturer explained pointedly, "The Continental Army -"

"What's Army?" a girl queried timidly.

The instructor acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The instructor seethed, "An army (from Latin arma 'arms, weapons' via Old French armée, 'armed' [feminine]), ground force or land force is a fighting force that fights primarily on land. In the broadest sense, it is the land-based military branch, service branch or armed service of a nation or state. It may also include aviation assets by possessing an army aviation component. Within a national military force, the word army may also mean a field army. In some countries, such as France and China, the term 'army', especially in its plural form 'armies', has the broader meaning of armed forces as a whole, while retaining the colloquial sense of land forces. To differentiate the colloquial army from the formal concept of military force, the term is qualified, for example in France the land force is called Armée de terre, meaning Land Army, and the air and space force is called Armée de l'Air et de l’Espace, meaning Air and Space Army. The naval force, although not using the term 'army', is also included in the broad sense of the term 'armies' — thus the French Navy -"

"What's French Navy?" a pupil demanded patiently.

The professor acknowledged the query with a smile.

The educator declared sullenly, "The French Navy -"

"What's Navy?" a boy asked sadly.

The professor acknowledged the query with a smile.

The teacher muttered excitedly, "A navy, naval force, or maritime force is the branch of a nation's armed forces principally designated for naval and amphibious warfare; namely, lake-borne, riverine, littoral, or ocean-borne combat operations and related functions. It includes anything conducted by surface ships, amphibious ships, submarines, and seaborne aviation, as well as ancillary support, communications, training, and other fields. The strategic offensive role of a navy is projection of force into areas beyond a country's shores (for example, to protect sea-lanes, deter or confront piracy, ferry troops, or attack other navies, ports, or shore installations). The strategic defensive purpose of a navy is to frustrate seaborne projection-of-force by enemies. The strategic task of the navy also may incorporate nuclear deterrence by use of submarine-launched ballistic missiles. Naval -"

The professor took a breath, expecting a query from the class about Naval or some other topic.

The educator proceeded.

"Now then, back again to French Navy....", the instructor sang quickly.

The class stifled their yawns.

"Alright, returning to Army....", the educator announced gingerly.

The class suppressed giggles.

"Now then, going back to Continental Army....", the educator breathed.

The pupils stifled their yawns.

"Now, turning back our attention to Commentaries on the Laws of England....", the educator announced calmly.

The class watched quietly.

"Now then, getting back to Court....", the teacher noted robotically.

The class stifled their yawns.

"Now then, getting back to West Coast of the United States....", the educator elaborated politely.

The students suppressed giggles.

"Now, getting back to West Coast of the United States....", the professor sang gently.

The pupils sat straighter in their seats.

"Now, back again to Seattle....", the teacher explained sullenly.

The class stifled their yawns.

"Alright, turning back our attention to Jerry Cantrell....", the schoolteacher murmured.

The class suppressed giggles.

"Well then, going back to Nico Constantine....", the teacher explained crudely.

The students sat straighter in their seats.

"Now, returning to Starbenders....", the teacher declared timidly.

The pupils sniggered.

The bell blared.

"That's all the time we have. I hope you learned something today," the instructor announced sadly.

The students exited the room.

# Lesson 27: Melton Constable Hall

"Good morning, class! Today we'll be discussing Melton Constable Hall," the educator muttered aggressively.

The students sat straighter in their seats.

The instructor noted breathlessly, "Melton Constable -"

"Who's Melton Constable?" a pupil questioned timidly.

The instructor paid no attention to the interruption and carried on.

The professor declared aggressively, "- Melton Constable Hall is a large (Grade I listed) country house in the parish of Melton Constable, Norfolk, England designed in the Christopher Wren -"

"What's Christopher Wren?" a girl piped up sadly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a nod.

The teacher said gently, "Sir -"

"What's Sir?" a student piped up carefully.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The teacher paid no heed to the interruption and proceeded.

The lecturer said sullenly, "- Sir Christopher Wren PRS FRS (; 30 October 1632 [O.S. 20 October] – 8 March 1723 [O.S. 25 February]) was one of the most highly acclaimed English architects in history, as well as an anatomist, astronomer, geometer, and mathematician-physicist. He was accorded responsibility for rebuilding 52 churches in the City of London after the Great Fire in 1666, including what is regarded as his masterpiece, St Paul's Cathedral, on Ludgate Hill -"

"What's Ludgate Hill?" a pupil blurted timidly.

The educator acknowledged the query with a nervous laugh.

The schoolteacher seethed carefully, "Ludgate -"

"What's Ludgate?" a pupil piped up gingerly.

The professor acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The teacher muttered sullenly, "Ludgate was the westernmost gate in London -"

"What's London?" a girl asked patiently.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the query with a nod.

The lecturer explained timidly, "London is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom. Standing on the River Thames -"

"What's River Thames?" a student interjected.

The educator paid no attention to the interruption and continued.

The educator breathed gingerly, "- River Thames in south-east England at the head of a 50-mile (80 km) estuary down to the North Sea, it has been a major settlement for two millennia. The City of London, its ancient core and financial centre, was founded by the Romans as Londinium -"

"What's Londinium?" a student asked calmly.

The instructor paid no attention to the interruption and continued.

The teacher said pointedly, "- Londinium and retains boundaries close to its medieval ones. Since the 19th century, 'London' has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between the counties of Middlesex, Essex -"

"What's Essex?" a girl questioned sadly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a nervous laugh.

The professor seethed confidently, "Sex is a trait that determines an individual's reproductive function, male or female, in animals and plants that propagate their species through sexual reproduction. The type of gametes produced by an organism define its sex. Commonly in plants and animals, male organisms produce smaller gametes (spermatozoa, sperm) while female organisms produce larger gametes (ova, often called egg cells). Organisms that produce both types of gametes are called hermaphrodites. During sexual reproduction, male and female gametes fuse to form zygotes that develop into offspring that inherit a selection of the traits of each parent. Male -"

"What's Male?" a girl demanded sadly.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The professor ignored the interruption and continued.

The educator seethed patiently, "- Males and females of a species may be similar (sexual monomorphism), or have physical differences (sexual dimorphism). The differences reflect the different reproductive pressures the sexes experience. For instance, mate choice and sexual selection can accelerate the evolution of physical differences between the sexes. The terms male and female typically do not apply in sexually undifferentiated species in which the individuals are isomorphic (look the same) and the gametes are isogamous (indistinguishable in size and shape), such as the green alga Ulva lactuca -"

The educator took a breath, waiting for a question from the class about Ulva lactuca or some other topic.

The class stifled their yawns.

The educator proceeded.

The lecturer murmured quietly, "- Ulva lactuca. If there are instead functional differences between gametes, such as in fungi, they may be referred to as mating types.Sex is genetically determined in most mammals by the XY sex-determination system, where male mammals carry an X and a Y chromosome -"

"What's Y chromosome?" a boy blurted timidly.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The lecturer murmured quietly, "A chromosome is a long DNA molecule with part or all of the genetic material of an organism. Most eukaryotic chromosomes include packaging proteins called histones which, aided by chaperone proteins, bind to and condense the DNA molecule to maintain its integrity. These chromosomes display a complex three-dimensional structure, which plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation.Chromosomes are normally visible under a light microscope only during the metaphase of cell division (where all chromosomes are aligned in the center of the cell in their condensed form). Before this happens, each chromosome is duplicated (S phase -"

"What's S phase?" a pupil raised politely.

The teacher ignored the interruption and proceeded.

The schoolteacher elaborated happily, "- S phase), and both copies are joined by a centromere, resulting either in an X-shaped structure (pictured above), if the centromere is located equatorially, or a two-arm structure, if the centromere is located distally. The joined copies are now called sister chromatids. During metaphase the X-shaped structure is called a metaphase chromosome, which is highly condensed and thus easiest to distinguish and study. In animal cells, chromosomes reach their highest compaction level in anaphase during chromosome segregation.Chromosomal recombination during meiosis and subsequent sexual reproduction play a significant role in genetic diversity. If these structures are manipulated incorrectly, through processes known as chromosomal instability and translocation, the cell may undergo mitotic catastrophe. Usually, this will make the cell initiate apoptosis leading to its own death, but sometimes mutations in the cell hamper this process and thus cause progression of cancer. Some use the term chromosome in a wider sense, to refer to the individualized portions of chromatin in cells, either visible or not under light microscopy. Others use the concept in a narrower sense, to refer to the individualized portions of chromatin during cell division, visible under light microscopy due to high condensation. The word chromosome () comes from the Greek χρῶμα (chroma, 'colour') and σῶμα (soma, 'body'), describing their strong staining by particular dyes. The term was coined by the German anatomist Heinrich Wilhelm Waldeyer, referring to the term chromatin, which was introduced by Walther Flemming, the discoverer of cell division. Some of the early karyological terms have become outdated. For example, Chromatin -"

"Who's Chromatin?" a pupil interjected happily.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The lecturer announced, "Chromatin is a complex of DNA -"

The schoolteacher stopped, anticipating a query from the class about DNA or some other topic.

The educator continued.

The teacher said gingerly, "- DNA and protein found in eukaryotic cells. The primary function is to package long DNA molecules into more compact, denser structures. This prevents the strands from becoming tangled and also plays important roles in reinforcing the DNA during cell division preventing DNA damage and regulating gene expression and DNA replication -"

"What's DNA replication?" a pupil asked quickly.

The educator acknowledged the query with a smile.

The professor breathed sadly, "In molecular biology, DNA -"

"What's DNA?" a boy demanded furiously.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a nervous laugh.

The schoolteacher disregarded the interruption and carried on.

The professor sang calmly, "- DNA replication is the biological process of producing two identical replicas of DNA from one original DNA molecule. DNA replication occurs in all living organisms acting as the most essential part for biological inheritance. This is essential for cell division during growth and repair of damaged tissues, while it also ensures that each of the new cells receives its own copy of the DNA. The cell possesses the distinctive property of division, which makes replication of DNA essential. DNA is made up of a double helix of two complementary strands. The double helix describes the appearance of a double-stranded DNA which is thus composed of two linear strands that run opposite to each other and twist together to form. During replication, these strands are separated. Each strand of the original DNA molecule then serves as a template for the production of its counterpart, a process referred to as semiconservative replication. As a result of semi-conservative replication, the new helix will be composed of an original DNA strand -"

"What's DNA strand?" a pupil questioned quickly.

The educator acknowledged the query with a nod.

The educator murmured confidently, "Deoxyribonucleic acid ( (listen); DNA) is a molecule composed of two polynucleotide chains that coil around each other to form a double helix carrying genetic instructions for the development, functioning, growth and reproduction of all known organisms and many viruses. DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA -"

The lecturer halted, expecting a question from the students about RNA or some other topic.

The class watched quietly.

The professor continued.

The teacher elaborated furiously, "- RNA) are nucleic acids. Alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), nucleic acids are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. The two DNA strands are known as polynucleotides as they are composed of simpler monomeric units called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogen-containing nucleobases (cytosine [C], guanine [G], adenine [A] or thymine [T]), a sugar called deoxyribose, and a phosphate group. The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by covalent bonds (known as the phospho-diester linkage) between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone. The nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together, according to base pairing rules (A with T and C with G), with hydrogen bonds to make double-stranded DNA. The complementary nitrogenous bases are divided into two groups, pyrimidines and purines. In DNA, the pyrimidines are thymine and cytosine; the purines are adenine and guanine. Both strands of double-stranded DNA store the same biological information. This information is replicated as and when the two strands separate. A large part of DNA (more than 98% for humans) is non-coding, meaning that these sections do not serve as patterns for protein sequences. The two strands of DNA run in opposite directions to each other and are thus antiparallel. Attached to each sugar is one of four types of nucleobases (or bases). It is the sequence of these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes genetic information. RNA strands are created using DNA strands as a template in a process called transcription, where DNA bases are exchanged for their corresponding bases except in the case of thymine (T), for which RNA substitutes uracil (U). Under the genetic code, these RNA strands specify the sequence of amino acids within proteins in a process called translation. Within eukaryotic cells, DNA is organized into long structures called chromosomes. Before typical cell division, these chromosomes are duplicated in the process of DNA replication -"

The schoolteacher halted, waiting for a query from the class about DNA replication or some other topic.

The class suppressed giggles.

The educator continued.

"Now then, getting back to DNA replication....", the lecturer announced happily.

The class sniggered.

"So, getting back to Chromatin....", the instructor breathed crudely.

The class listened in rapt attention.

"Well then, back again to Chromosome....", the teacher explained slowly.

The pupils watched quietly.

"Well then, going back to Sex....", the instructor declared crudely.

The pupils listened in rapt attention.

"Now then, back again to London....", the professor announced sadly.

The pupils watched quietly.

"Well then, turning back our attention to Ludgate....", the lecturer murmured politely.

The class sat straighter in their seats.

"So, back again to Ludgate Hill....", the teacher declared robotically.

The class watched quietly.

"Well then, back again to Christopher Wren....", the educator announced gently.

The pupils sniggered.

"Now, getting back to Melton Constable Hall....", the lecturer elaborated sullenly.

The class sat straighter in their seats.

The bell blared.

"That's all the time we have. I hope you learned something today," the professor explained confidently.

The students exited the room breathlessly.
