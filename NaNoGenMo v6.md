# Lesson 2: Transition metal alkene complex

"Greetings, class! Today we'll be studying Transition metal alkene complex," the schoolteacher announced calmly.

The pupils stifled their yawns.

The teacher elaborated, "In organometallic chemistry, a transition metal alkene complex is a coordination compound containing one or more alkene ligands. Such compounds are intermediates in many catalytic reactions that convert alkenes to other organic products.Mono- and dialkenes are often used as ligands in stable complexes. The simplest monoalkene is ethene. Many complexes of ethene are known, including Zeise's salt -"

The instructor looked around, anticipating a query from the pupils about Zeise's salt or some other topic.

The students stifled their yawns.

The teacher carried on.

The instructor sang gently, "- Zeise's salt (see figure), Rh2Cl2(C2H4)4, Cp*2Ti(C2H4), and the homoleptic Ni(C2H4)3. Substituted monoalkene include the cyclic cyclooctene, as found in chlorobis(cyclooctene)rhodium dimer. Alkenes with electron-withdrawing groups commonly bind strongly to low-valent metals. Examples of such ligands are TCNE -"

The teacher stopped, anticipating a query from the pupils about TCNE or some other topic.

The pupils suppressed giggles.

The teacher proceeded.

The schoolteacher announced, "- TCNE, tetrafluoroethylene, maleic anhydride, and esters of fumaric acid. These acceptors form adducts with many zero-valent metals. Butadiene -"

The professor took a breath, waiting for a query from the pupils about Butadiene or some other topic.

The lecturer proceeded.

The instructor breathed slowly, "- Butadiene, cyclooctadiene, and norbornadiene are well-studied chelating agents. Trienes and even some tetraenes can bind to metals through several adjacent carbon centers. Common examples of such ligands are cycloheptatriene and cyclooctatetraene. The bonding is often denoted using the hapticity formalism. Keto-alkenes are tetrahapto ligands that stabilize highly unsaturated low valent metals as found in (benzylideneacetone)iron tricarbonyl and tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0). Metal alkene complexes. The bonding between alkenes and transition metals is described by the Dewar–Chatt–Duncanson model -"

The professor took a breath, waiting for a query from the class about Dewar–Chatt–Duncanson model or some other topic.

The students suppressed giggles.

The teacher continued.

The instructor noted breathlessly, "- Dewar–Chatt–Duncanson model, which involves donation of electrons in the pi-orbital on the alkene to empty orbitals on the metal. This interaction is reinforced by back bonding that entails sharing of electrons in other metal orbitals into the empty pi-antibonding level on the alkene. Early metals of low oxidation state (Ti(II), Zr(II), Nb(III) etc.) are strong pi donors, and their alkene complexes are often described as metallacyclopropanes. Treatment of such species with acids gives the alkanes. Late metals (Ir(I), Pt(II)), which are poorer pi-donors, tend to engage the alkene as a Lewis acid -"

The professor looked around, waiting for a query from the pupils about Lewis acid or some other topic.

The instructor continued.

The teacher noted gently, "- Lewis acid–Lewis base -"

"What's Lewis base?" a student raised gingerly.

The schoolteacher ignored the interruption and continued.

The teacher declared carefully, "- Lewis base interaction. Similarly, C2F4 is a stronger pi-acceptor than C2H4, as reflected in metal-carbon bond distances. Bonding images The barrier for the rotation of the alkene about the M-centroid vector is a measure of the strength of the M-alkene pi-bond. Low symmetry complexes are suitable for analysis of these rotational barriers associated with the metal-ethene bond.In CpRh(C2H4)(C2F4), the ethene ligand is observed to rotate with a barrier near 12 kcal/mol but no rotation is observed for about the Rh-C2F4 bond. Alkene ligands lose much of their unsaturated character upon complexation. Most famously, the alkene ligand undergoes migratory insertion, wherein it is attacked intramolecularly by alkyl and hydride ligands to form new alkyl complexes. Cationic alkene complexes are susceptible to attack by nucleophiles. Metal alkene complexes are intermediates in many or most transition metal catalyzed reactions of alkenes: polymerization., hydrogenation, hydroformylation, and many other reactions. Since alkenes are mainly produced as mixtures with alkanes, the separation of alkanes and alkenes is of commercial interest. Separation technologies often rely on facilitated transport membranes containing Ag+ or Cu+ salts that reversibly bind alkenes.In argentation chromatography, stationary phases that contain silver salts are used to analyze organic compounds on the basis of the number and type of alkene (olefin) groups. This methodology is commonly employed for the analysis of the unsaturated content in fats and fatty acids. Metal-alkene complexes are uncommon in nature, with one exception. Ethene -"

"Who's Ethene?" a girl raised quickly.

The teacher paid no heed to the interruption and proceeded.

The bell sounded.

"That's all the time we have. I hope you learned something today," the teacher seethed sadly.

The students crowded out of the room breathlessly.

John Dadford was the third son of the canal engineer Thomas Dadford and his wife Frances Brown, the daughter of a Wolverhampton toymaker called Samuel Brown. They lived in the Wolverhampton area, and it is probable that John was born in that area. His older brothers were Thomas and James, both of whom worked as canal engineers. He had a younger brother called William and a sister called Mary. He is known to have been a pupil at Sedgley Park Roman Catholic School between May 1778 and June 1781. By 1790, he was working as an engineer, assisting his father and his brother Thomas with surveys for the Neath Canal. His involvement with the construction of the Glamorganshire Canal -"

The instructor noted quickly, "Adolescence (from Latin adolescere 'to mature') is a transitional stage of physical and psychological development that generally occurs during the period from puberty to legal adulthood (age of majority). Adolescence is usually associated with the teenage years, but its physical, psychological or cultural expressions may begin earlier and end later. For example, puberty now typically begins during preadolescence, particularly in females. Physical growth (particularly in males) and cognitive development can extend into the early twenties. Thus, age provides only a rough marker of adolescence, and scholars have found it difficult to agree upon a precise definition of adolescence.A thorough understanding of adolescence in society depends on information from various perspectives, including psychology, biology, history, sociology, education, and anthropology. Within all of these perspectives, adolescence is viewed as a transitional period between childhood and adulthood, whose cultural purpose is the preparation of children for adult roles. It is a period of multiple transitions involving education, training, employment, and unemployment, as well as transitions from one living circumstance to another.The end of adolescence and the beginning of adulthood varies by country. Furthermore, even within a single nation, state or culture, there can be different ages at which an individual is considered mature enough for society to entrust them with certain privileges and responsibilities. Such privileges and responsibilities include driving a vehicle, having legal sexual relations, serving in the armed forces or on a jury, purchasing and drinking alcohol, purchase of tobacco products, voting, entering into contracts, finishing certain levels of education, marriage, and accountability for upholding the law. Adolescence is usually accompanied by an increased independence allowed by the parents or legal guardians, including less supervision as compared to preadolescence. In studying adolescent development, adolescence can be defined biologically, as the physical transition marked by the onset of puberty and the termination of physical growth; cognitively, as changes in the ability to think abstractly and multi-dimensionally; or socially, as a period of preparation for adult roles. Major pubertal and biological changes include changes to the sex organs, height, weight, and muscle mass, as well as major changes in brain structure and organization. Cognitive advances encompass both increment in knowledge and in the ability to think abstractly and to reason more effectively. The study of adolescent development often involves interdisciplinary collaborations. For example, researchers in neuroscience or bio-behavioral health might focus on pubertal changes in brain structure and its effects on cognition or social relations. Sociologists interested in adolescence might focus on the acquisition of social roles (e.g., worker or romantic partner) and how this varies across cultures or social conditions. Developmental psychologists might focus on changes in relations with parents and peers as a function of school structure and pubertal status. Some scientists have questioned the universality of adolescence as a developmental phase, arguing that traits often considered typical of adolescents are not in fact inherent to the teenage years. Puberty -"

It spans an area of approximately 14,060,000 km2 (5,430,000 sq mi) and is also known as the coldest of all the oceans. The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) recognizes it as an ocean, although some oceanographers call it the Arctic Mediterranean Sea -"

The instructor looked around, anticipating a question from the pupils about Mediterranean Sea or some other topic.

The pupils watched quietly.

The instructor continued.

The teacher elaborated politely, "- Mediterranean Sea -"

"What's Sea?" a student asked mechanically.

The instructor acknowledged the query with a smile.

The teacher ignored the interruption and proceeded.

The professor breathed quietly, "- Sea. It has been described approximately as an estuary of the Atlantic Ocean -"

The teacher stopped, anticipating a query from the students about Atlantic Ocean or some other topic.

The class listened in rapt attention.

The educator continued.

The professor breathed aggressively, "- Atlantic Ocean. It is also seen as the northernmost part of the all-encompassing World Ocean. The Arctic Ocean includes the North Pole -"

The educator stopped, expecting a question from the pupils about North Pole or some other topic.

The lecturer carried on.

The lecturer declared quickly, "- North Pole region in the middle of the Northern Hemisphere -"

"What's Northern Hemisphere?" a pupil piped up crudely.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a grin.

The instructor breathed crudely, "The North -"

"What's North?" a girl said aggressively.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the query with a nod.

The educator muttered, "Birth -"

"What's Mammal?" a pupil queried aggressively.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The schoolteacher sang sullenly, "Mammals (from Latin mamma, 'breast') are a group of vertebrate animals constituting the class Mammalia -"

The professor looked around, listening for a query from the pupils about Mammalia or some other topic.

The pupils watched quietly.

The teacher carried on.

The schoolteacher muttered quietly, "- Mammalia (), and characterized by the presence of mammary glands which in females produce milk for feeding (nursing) their young, a neocortex (a region of the brain), fur or hair, and three middle ear bones. These characteristics distinguish them from reptiles and birds, from which they diverged in the Carboniferous -"

The professor halted, anticipating a question from the pupils about Carboniferous or some other topic.

The pupils stifled their yawns.

The lecturer continued.

The instructor explained slowly, "- Carboniferous, over 300 million years ago. Around 6,400 extant species of mammals have been described. The largest orders are the rodents, bats and Eulipotyphla (hedgehogs, moles, shrews, and others). The next three are the Primate -"

The lecturer paused, waiting for a query from the students about Primate or some other topic.

The educator proceeded.

The teacher elaborated politely, "- Primates -"

"What's Primates?" a pupil demanded slowly.

The professor paid no heed to the interruption and continued.

"Okay, going back to Birth....", the lecturer muttered quietly.

The pupils sniggered.

The schoolteacher seethed breathlessly, "-  -"

The schoolteacher looked around, anticipating a question from the class about Hormone or some other topic.

The class suppressed giggles.

The teacher continued.

"Now, getting back to Northern Hemisphere....", the professor sang aggressively.

The class watched quietly.

The lecturer explained breathlessly, "- Northern Hemisphere is the half of the Earth -"

The teacher took a breath, expecting a query from the class about Earth or some other topic.

The professor continued.

"Well then, turning back our attention to Arctic Ocean....", the instructor murmured gingerly.

The class sniggered.

"Alright, returning to Canada....", the professor murmured carefully.

The students sniggered.

"Well then, going back to Ontario....", the lecturer seethed robotically.

The students stifled their yawns.

"Now then, back again to Southern Ontario....", the professor explained excitedly.

The pupils watched quietly.

"Alright, turning back our attention to Southwestern Ontario....", the lecturer breathed carefully.

The class watched quietly.

The professor muttered calmly, "- Southern Ontario in the Canadian province of Ontario. It occupies most of the Ontario Peninsula bounded by Lake Huron -"

"What's Lake Huron?" a girl raised calmly.

The instructor acknowledged the query with a nod.

The schoolteacher explained sullenly, "Lake -"

"What's Lake?" a boy queried crudely.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a nervous laugh.

The educator noted slowly, "Love encompasses a range of strong and positive emotional and mental states, from the most sublime virtue or good habit, the deepest interpersonal affection, to the simplest pleasure. An example of this range of meanings is that the love of a mother differs from the love of a spouse, which differs from the love of food. Most commonly, love refers to a feeling of a strong attraction and emotional attachment.Love is considered to be both positive and negative, with its virtue representing human kindness, compassion, and affection, as 'the unselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another' and its vice representing human moral flaw, akin to vanity, selfishness, amour-propre, and egotism, as potentially leading people into a type of mania, obsessiveness or codependency. It may also describe compassionate and affectionate actions towards other humans, one's self, or animals. In its various forms, love acts as a major facilitator of interpersonal relationships and, owing to its central psychological importance, is one of the most common themes in the creative arts. Love has been postulated to be a function that keeps human beings together against menaces and to facilitate the continuation of the species.Ancient Greek philosophers identified six forms of love: essentially, familial love (in Greek, Storge -"

"What's Storge?" a pupil quizzed aggressively.

The professor acknowledged the query with a nod.

The lecturer paid no attention to the interruption and continued.

The educator announced gently, "- Storge), friendly love or platonic love (Philia -"

The professor took a breath, expecting a question from the class about Philia or some other topic.

The pupils stifled their yawns.

The teacher carried on.

The teacher seethed crudely, "- Philia), romantic love (Eros), self-love (Philautia -"

The educator looked around, anticipating a question from the students about Philautia or some other topic.

The educator continued.

The instructor murmured gently, "- Philautia), guest love (Xenia), and divine love (Agape -"

"Who's Agape?" a student raised calmly.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a nod.

The lecturer sang crudely, "Algae (; singular alga ) is an informal term for a large and diverse group of photosynthetic eukaryotic organisms. It is a polyphyletic grouping that includes species from multiple distinct clades. Included organisms range from unicellular microalgae, such as Chlorella -"

The educator looked around, anticipating a question from the pupils about Chlorella or some other topic.

The students listened in rapt attention.

The teacher proceeded.

The schoolteacher seethed confidently, "- Chlorella, Prototheca -"

The instructor paused, waiting for a query from the class about Prototheca or some other topic.

The schoolteacher continued.

The professor explained patiently, "- Prototheca and the diatoms, to multicellular forms, such as the giant kelp, a large brown alga which may grow up to 50 metres (160 ft) in length. Most are aquatic and autotrophic and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types, such as stomata, xylem and phloem, which are found in land plants. The largest and most complex marine algae are called seaweeds, while the most complex freshwater forms are the Charophyta -"

"What's Charophyta?" a boy demanded patiently.

The instructor acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The lecturer murmured politely, "The Charophyta (UK: ) or charophytes () is a group of freshwater green algae, sometimes treated as a division, but also as a superdivision, or an unranked clade. The terrestrial plants, the Embryophyta -"

"What's Embryophyta?" a boy piped up slowly.

The professor acknowledged the query with a grin.

The teacher seethed sadly, "The Embryophyta (), or land plants, are the most familiar group of green plants that comprise vegetation on Earth. Embryophyta is a clade within the Phragmoplast -"

"What's Phragmoplast?" a girl demanded aggressively.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a smile.

The teacher muttered calmly, "The phragmoplast is a plant cell specific structure that forms during late cytokinesis. It serves as a scaffold for cell plate assembly and subsequent formation of a new cell wall separating the two daughter cells. The phragmoplast can only be observed in Phragmoplastophyta, a clade that includes the Coleochaetophyceae, Zygnematophyceae -"

The instructor halted, expecting a query from the students about Zygnematophyceae or some other topic.

The class sniggered.

The educator proceeded.

The professor announced happily, "- Zygnematophyceae, Mesotaeniaceae -"

"Who's Mesotaeniaceae?" a girl queried robotically.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The educator announced timidly, "The Mesotaeniaceae are a small family of unicellular green algae known as the 'saccoderm desmids'. The Mesotaeniaceae appear to be sister or ancestral to the Zygnemataceae -"

"What's Zygnemataceae?" a student said sadly.

The educator acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The instructor elaborated quietly, "The Zygnema -"

The educator halted, expecting a question from the pupils about Zygnema or some other topic.

The class suppressed giggles.

The lecturer carried on.

The schoolteacher seethed quickly, "- Zygnemataceae are a family of filamentous or unicellular, uniseriate (unbranched) green algae. The filaments are septated and reproduction is by conjugation; Spirogyra is commonly used in schools to demonstrate this kind of reproduction. The family is notable for its diversely shaped chloroplasts, such as stellate in Zygnema, helical in Spirogyra, and flat in Mougeotia -"

The teacher halted, expecting a question from the class about Mougeotia or some other topic.

The instructor continued.

The lecturer noted sullenly, "- Mougeotia. The Zygnemataceae are cosmopolitan, but though all generally occur in the same types of habitats, Mougeotia, Spirogyra, and Zygnema are by far the most common; in one study across North America, 95% of the Zygnemataceae collected were in these three genera. Classification and identification is primarily by the morphology of the conjugation, which is somewhat rare to find in natural populations of permanent water bodies; when in the vegetative state, the rarer genera resemble the three most common, and are often mistaken for them and catalogued as such. Conjugation can be induced in low-nitrogen culture. While they occupy many habitats, in North America all are found solely in freshwater or subaerial habitats. Species typically exist as floating mats in stagnant water in ditches and ponds, but some also grow in moving water, attaching themselves to a substrate by rhizoid-like projections of the basal cells of the filament. The mat species rise to the surface in early spring, grow rapidly through the summer, disappearing by late summer. Members of the Zygnemataceae, such as Spirogyra, fall prey to parasites, especially chytrids. Most genera (all except Mesotanium and Spirotaenia) previously assigned to Mesotaeniaceae as well as the Desmidiales -"

"Who's Desmidiales?" a pupil blurted patiently.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a nervous laugh.

The instructor noted quietly, "Desmidiales, commonly called desmids (Gr. desmos, bond or chain), are an order in the Charophyta, a division of green algae in which the land plants (Embryophyta -"

"What's Embryophyta?" a girl quizzed patiently.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the query with a smile.

The schoolteacher breathed pointedly, "The Embryo -"

"What's Embryo?" a student questioned gingerly.

The educator acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The instructor explained politely, "An embryo is the early stage of development of a multicellular organism. In general, in organisms that reproduce sexually, embryonic development is the part of the life cycle that begins just after fertilization and continues through the formation of body structures, such as tissues and organs. Each embryo starts development as a zygote, a single cell resulting from the fusion of gametes (i.e. the process of fertilization which is the fusion of a female egg cell and a male sperm cell). In the first stages of embryonic development, a single-celled zygote undergoes many rapid cell divisions, called cleavage, to form a blastula, which looks similar to a ball of cells. Next, the cells in a blastula-stage embryo start rearranging themselves into layers in a process called gastrulation. These layers will each give rise to different parts of the developing multicellular organism, such as the nervous system, connective tissue, and organs. A newly developing human is typically referred to as an embryo until the ninth week after conception, when it is then referred to as a fetus. In other multicellular organisms, the word 'embryo' can be used more broadly to any early developmental or life cycle stage prior to birth or hatching. First attested in English in the mid-14c., the word embryon derives from Medieval Latin -"

"What's Medieval Latin?" a student piped up quickly.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a smile.

The instructor noted carefully, "Medieval Latin -"

The teacher looked around, waiting for a query from the students about Latin or some other topic.

The class sniggered.

The educator proceeded.

The educator muttered mechanically, "- Latin was the form of Latin used in Roman Catholic Western Europe -"

"What's Western Europe?" a girl raised carefully.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a smirk.

The educator breathed calmly, "Western Europe -"

The professor looked around, waiting for a question from the class about Europe or some other topic.

The educator continued.

The instructor seethed robotically, "- Europe is the European region farthest from Asia. The region's countries and territories vary depending on context. Beginning with foreign exploration during the Age of Discovery, roughly from the 15th century, the concept of Europe as 'the West' gradually became distinguished from and eventually replaced the dominant use of 'Christendom -"

"What's Christendom?" a pupil blurted confidently.

The professor acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The teacher seethed, "Christendom historically refers to the 'Christian world': Christian state -"

The lecturer halted, expecting a query from the students about Christian state or some other topic.

The students sat straighter in their seats.

The schoolteacher continued.

The instructor explained quickly, "- Christian states, Christian-majority countries and the countries in which Christianity -"

The professor took a breath, listening for a query from the class about Christianity or some other topic.

The class watched quietly.

The schoolteacher carried on.

"Now, turning back our attention to Western Europe....", the educator sang sullenly.

The pupils stifled their yawns.

The pupils sniggered.

"So, getting back to Brantford....", the lecturer announced excitedly.

The pupils listened in rapt attention.

"Alright, turning back our attention to Janet Carnochan....", the teacher announced happily.

The class sniggered.

The bell rang.

"That's all the time we have. I hope you learned something today," the professor seethed gently.

The class crowded out of the room breathlessly.

# Lesson 8: Metal Slug Advance

"Hello and welcome, class! Today we'll be learning about Metal Slug Advance," the professor said robotically.

The students watched quietly.

The teacher explained pointedly, "Metal Slug -"

"What's Metal Slug?" a girl interjected carefully.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the query with a nod.

The schoolteacher paid no heed to the interruption and continued.

The professor announced mechanically, "- Metal Slug Advance is a run and gun video game for the Game Boy Advance -"

"What's Game Boy Advance?" a pupil quizzed aggressively.

The professor acknowledged the question with a nervous laugh.

The schoolteacher sang calmly, "The Game Boy Advance (GBA -"

The professor took a breath, waiting for a question from the pupils about GBA or some other topic.

The class listened in rapt attention.

The teacher proceeded.

The educator explained happily, "- GBA) is a 32-bit handheld game console developed, manufactured and marketed by Nintendo as the successor to the Game Boy Color -"

The schoolteacher looked around, waiting for a query from the students about Game Boy Color or some other topic.

The pupils sniggered.

The instructor continued.

The schoolteacher seethed sadly, "- Game Boy Color. It was released in Japan -"

"What's Japan?" a pupil blurted robotically.

The professor acknowledged the question with a nervous laugh.

The professor elaborated breathlessly, "Japan (Japanese: 日本, Nippon -"

"What's Nippon?" a boy quizzed slowly.

The instructor acknowledged the question with a grin.

The schoolteacher elaborated gingerly, "Japan (Japanese: 日本, Nippon -"

"What's Nippon?" a girl quizzed confidently.

The educator acknowledged the question with a nervous laugh.

The instructor muttered mechanically, "Japan (Japanese: 日本, Nippon or Nihon, and formally 日本国) is an island country in East Asia -"

The instructor halted, anticipating a query from the pupils about East Asia or some other topic.

The class watched quietly.

The schoolteacher proceeded.

The professor explained carefully, "- East Asia -"

"What's Asia?" a pupil demanded quietly.

The instructor acknowledged the question with a smirk.

The teacher muttered happily, "Asia ( (listen)) is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the Eastern and Northern Hemisphere -"

"What's Northern Hemisphere?" a girl said quickly.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a grin.

The lecturer murmured robotically, "The Northern Hemisphere is the half of the Earth that is north of the Equator -"

"What's Equator?" a student quizzed calmly.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a nod.

The lecturer ignored the interruption and carried on.

The educator breathed happily, "- Equator. For other planets in the Solar System -"

"What's Solar System?" a boy raised excitedly.

The professor acknowledged the question with a smirk.

The lecturer seethed patiently, "A star system or stellar system is a small number of stars that orbit each other, bound by gravitational attraction. A large group of stars bound by gravitation is generally called a star cluster or galaxy, although, broadly speaking, they are also star systems. Star -"

"What's Star?" a girl piped up aggressively.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a smile.

The schoolteacher paid no attention to the interruption and proceeded.

The lecturer elaborated gently, "- Star systems are not to be confused with planetary systems, which include planets and similar bodies (such as comets). A star system of two stars is known as a binary star, binary star system or physical double star. If there are no tidal effects, no perturbation from other forces, and no transfer of mass from one star to the other, such a system is stable, and both stars will trace out an elliptical orbit around the barycenter of the system indefinitely. (See Two-body problem -"

The instructor looked around, expecting a question from the pupils about Two-body problem or some other topic.

The lecturer continued.

The instructor elaborated confidently, "- Two-body problem). Examples of binary systems are Sirius -"

The schoolteacher halted, anticipating a question from the pupils about Sirius or some other topic.

The class stifled their yawns.

The lecturer proceeded.

The lecturer breathed timidly, "- Sirius, Procyon and Cygnus X-1 -"

The instructor halted, anticipating a question from the students about Cygnus X-1 or some other topic.

The professor proceeded.

The teacher seethed furiously, "- Cygnus X-1, the last of which probably consists of a star and a black hole. A multiple star system consists of three or more stars that appear from Earth -"

The instructor stopped, anticipating a question from the pupils about Earth or some other topic.

The pupils sniggered.

The educator carried on.

The schoolteacher explained crudely, "- Earth to be close to one another in the sky. This may result from the stars actually being physically close and gravitationally bound to each other, in which case it is a physical multiple star, or this closeness may be merely apparent, in which case it is an optical multiple star Physical multiple stars are also commonly called multiple stars or multiple star systems.Most multiple star systems are triple stars. Systems with four or more components are less likely to occur. Multiple-star systems are called triple, ternary, or trinary if they contain 3 stars; quadruple or quaternary if they contain 4 stars; quintuple or quintenary with 5 stars; sextuple or sextenary with 6 stars; septuple or septenary with 7 stars. These systems are smaller than open star clusters, which have more complex dynamics and typically have from 100 to 1,000 stars. Most multiple star systems known are triple; for higher multiplicities, the number of known systems with a given multiplicity decreases exponentially with multiplicity. For example, in the 1999 revision of Tokovinin's catalog of physical multiple stars, 551 out of the 728 systems described are triple. However, because of suspected selection effects, the ability to interpret these statistics is very limited.Multiple-star systems can be divided into two main dynamical classes: (1) hierarchical systems, which are stable, and consist of nested orbits that don't interact much, and so each level of the hierarchy can be treated as a Two-body problemor (2) the trapezia which have unstable strongly interacting orbits and are modelled as an n-body problem, exhibiting chaotic behavior. They can have 2, 3, or 4 stars. Most multiple-star systems are organized in what is called a hierarchical system: the stars in the system can be divided into two smaller groups, each of which traverses a larger orbit around the system's center of mass. Each of these smaller groups must also be hierarchical, which means that they must be divided into smaller subgroups which themselves are hierarchical, and so on. Each level of the hierarchy can be treated as a two-body problem by considering close pairs as if they were a single star. In these systems there is little interaction between the orbits and the stars' motion will continue to approximate stable Keplerian orbits around the system's center of mass, unlike the unstable trapezia systems or the even more complex dynamics of the large number of stars in star clusters and galaxies. In a physical triple star system, each star orbits the center of mass of the system. Usually, two of the stars form a close binary system, and the third orbits this pair at a distance much larger than that of the binary orbit. This arrangement is called hierarchical. The reason for this arrangement is that if the inner and outer orbits are comparable in size, the system may become dynamically unstable, leading to a star being ejected from the system. HR 6819 -"

"What's HR 6819?" a girl said pointedly.

The professor acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The professor sang crudely, "HR 6819, also known as HD 167128 or QV Telescopii (abbreviated QV Tel), is a double or triple star system in the southern constellation of Telescopium -"

"Who's Telescopium?" a boy quizzed sadly.

The professor ignored the interruption and proceeded.

The teacher noted quickly, "- Telescopium. It is in the south-western corner of the constellation, near Pavo to the south and Ara to the west. The system appears as a variable star that is dimly visible to the naked eye with an apparent magnitude that ranges from 5.32 down to 5.39, which is comparable to the maximum brightness of the planet Uranus -"

The instructor took a breath, listening for a query from the students about Uranus or some other topic.

The pupils sniggered.

The professor continued.

The instructor elaborated furiously, "- Uranus. It is about 1,120 light years from the Sun -"

The lecturer took a breath, expecting a question from the students about Sun or some other topic.

The class sat straighter in their seats.

The educator continued.

The lecturer seethed quickly, "- Sun, and is drifting farther away at a rate of 9.4 km/s. Due to its location in the sky, it is visible only to observers south of 33°N latitude. A May 2020 study hypothesized that the system has the closest known black hole, and the first one in a system visible to the naked eye. But a study in July of the same year concluded that rather than a triple system it was much more likely to be a black hole and a star orbiting at one distance from here and another star at a different distance. Three further 2020 papers argued that HR 6819 is a binary system with two mainstream stars and no black hole at all. HR 6819 is the Bright Star Catalogue -"

The teacher halted, waiting for a query from the students about Bright Star Catalogue or some other topic.

The instructor continued.

"Now, going back to Star system....", the lecturer murmured confidently.

The class sniggered.

"Alright, getting back to Northern Hemisphere....", the instructor muttered breathlessly.

The class sniggered.

"Okay, returning to Asia....", the teacher seethed breathlessly.

# Lesson 9: Sceptridium jenmanii

"Hello, class! Today we'll be covering Sceptridium jenmanii," the educator sang timidly.

The class watched quietly.

The schoolteacher breathed sullenly, "Sceptridium -"

"What's Sceptridium?" a girl blurted sadly.

The instructor acknowledged the query with a nod.

The instructor breathed politely, "Sceptridium is a genus of seedless vascular plants in the family Ophioglossaceae -"

The schoolteacher stopped, listening for a query from the students about Ophioglossaceae or some other topic.

The pupils sat straighter in their seats.

The lecturer proceeded.

The educator sang carefully, "- Ophioglossaceae, closely allied to (and often included as a subgenus of) the genus Botrychium (the moonworts and grapeferns). It is also closely related to the genus Botrypus (the rattlesnake fern, often treated as the subgenus Osmundopteris under Botrychium). Sceptridium species are commonly called the grape-ferns. These plants are small with fleshy roots, and reproduce by spores shed into the air. They differ from the moonworts in having at least some sterile fronds (all fronds in Botrychium are spore-bearing), and in the fronds being bi- or tri-pinnate (Botrychium are single pinnate, or rarely bipinnate); and from Botrypus in being evergreen, or at least winter-green (Botrypus are deciduous) and having the non-spore-bearing part of the frond long-stalked (short-stalked in Botrypus). Sceptridium species and their Botrychium synonyms include: Sceptridium dissectum -"

The teacher took a breath, expecting a query from the pupils about Sceptridium dissectum or some other topic.

The instructor proceeded.

The instructor announced robotically, "- Sceptridium dissectum (Spreng.)

Lyon 1905 – Alabama grape-fern Botrychium jenmanii Underw. 1900 Botrychium alabamense Maxon 1906 Sceptridium multifidum -"

"What's Sceptridium multifidum?" a student interjected excitedly.

The instructor acknowledged the query with a grin.

The professor elaborated aggressively, "Sceptridium -"

"What's Sceptridium?" a pupil said breathlessly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The teacher announced sadly, "Sceptridium is a genus of seedless vascular plants in the family Ophioglossaceae -"

The teacher paused, waiting for a question from the students about Ophioglossaceae or some other topic.

The pupils watched quietly.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The professor murmured timidly, "Botrychium is a genus of ferns, seedless vascular plants in the family Ophioglossaceae -"

"What's Ophioglossaceae?" a boy asked carefully.

The professor acknowledged the query with a grin.

The lecturer declared mechanically, "Ophioglossaceae, the adder's-tongue family, is a small family of ferns. In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), it is the only family in the order Ophioglossales, which together with the Psilotales is placed in the subclass Ophioglossidae -"

The instructor paused, listening for a question from the class about Ophioglossidae or some other topic.

The lecturer proceeded.

The educator announced quickly, "- Ophioglossidae. The Ophioglossidae are one of the groups traditionally known as eusporangiate ferns. Members of the family differ from other ferns in a number of ways. Many have only a single fleshy leaf at a time. Their gametophytes are subterranean and rely on fungi for energy. Members of Ophioglossaceae are usually terrestrial (excepting a few epiphytic species of Ophioglossum -"

"What's Ophioglossum?" a student said gently.

The instructor acknowledged the query with a nod.

The lecturer noted politely, "Ophioglossum, the adder's-tongue ferns, is a genus of about 50 species of ferns in the family Ophioglossaceae -"

The instructor stopped, listening for a question from the class about Ophioglossaceae or some other topic.

The instructor carried on.

The instructor declared confidently, "- Ophioglossaceae. The name Ophioglossum comes from the Greek, and means 'snake-tongue'. The genus has the largest number of chromosomes in the known plant kingdom, but contrary to popular belief does not have the largest number of chromosomes out of all known organisms, falling short to the protist Oxytricha trifallax -"

The instructor looked around, listening for a query from the students about Oxytricha trifallax or some other topic.

The class stifled their yawns.

The teacher proceeded.

The instructor said politely, "- Oxytricha trifallax. Their cosmopolitan distribution is mainly in tropical and subtropical habitats. Adders-tongues are so-called because the spore-bearing stalk is thought to resemble a snake's tongue. Each plant typically sends up a small, undivided leaf blade with netted venation, and the spore stalk forks from the leaf stalk, terminating in sporangia which are partially concealed within a structure with slit sides.When the leaf blade is present, there is not always a spore stalk present, and the plants do not always send up a leaf, sometimes going for a year to a period of years living only under the soil, nourished by association with soil fungi. The plant grows from a central, budding, fleshy structure with fleshy, radiating roots. Ophioglossum has a high chromosome count in comparison to other species, with 120 or up to 720 chromosomes possible in intervals of 120 due to polyploidy (multiple possible copies of chromosomes). It has almost 1260 number of chromosomes in the meiocyte (gamete mother cell) which undergo meiosis, the reduction division to form the gamete with only one set of chromosome getting incorporated into each gamete. As of April 2020, Plant -"

"What's Plant?" a pupil quizzed sadly.

The instructor acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The schoolteacher elaborated gingerly, "A plan is typically any diagram or list of steps with details of timing and resources, used to achieve an objective to do something. It is commonly understood as a temporal set of intended actions through which one expects to achieve a goal. For spatial or planar topologic or topographic sets see map. Plans can be formal or informal: Structured and formal plans, used by multiple people, are more likely to occur in projects, diplomacy, careers, economic development, military campaigns, combat, sports, games, or in the conduct of other business. In most cases, the absence of a well-laid plan can have adverse effects: for example, a non-robust project plan can cost the organization time and money. Informal or ad hoc plans are created by individuals in all of their pursuits.The most popular ways to describe plans are by their breadth, time frame, and specificity; however, these planning classifications are not independent of one another. For instance, there is a close relationship between the short- and long-term categories and the strategic and operational categories. It is common for less formal plans to be created as abstract ideas, and remain in that form as they are maintained and put to use. More formal plans as used for business and military purposes, while initially created with and as an abstract thought, are likely to be written down, drawn up or otherwise stored in a form that is accessible to multiple people across time and space. This allows more reliable collaboration in the execution of the plan. The term planning implies the working out of sub-components in some degree of elaborate detail. Broader-brush enunciations of objectives may qualify as metaphorical roadmaps. Planning -"

The educator proceeded.

The professor breathed crudely, "- Thomas Willis studied at Oxford University and took a physiological approach to the brain and behavior. It was Willis who coined the words 'hemisphere' and 'lobe' when referring to the brain. He was one of the earliest to use the words 'neurology' and 'psychology'. Rejecting the idea that humans were the only beings capable of rational thought, Willis looked at specialized structures of the brain. He theorized that higher structures accounted for complex functions, whereas lower structures were responsible for functions similar to those seen in other animals, consisting mostly of reactions and automatic responses. He was particularly interested in people who suffered from manic disorders and hysteria. His research constituted some of the first times that psychiatry and neurology came together to study individuals. Through his in-depth study of the brain and behavior, Willis concluded that automated responses such as breathing, heartbeats and other various motor activities were carried out within the lower region of the brain. Although much of his work has been made obsolete, his ideas presented the brain as more complex than previously imagined, and led the way for future pioneers to understand and build upon his theories, especially when it came to looking at disorders and dysfunctions in the brain.

The instructor looked around, waiting for a query from the class about Brain death or some other topic.

The pupils listened in rapt attention.

The instructor carried on.

The instructor breathed excitedly, "- Brain death is sometimes used as a legal definition of death. The remains of a previously living organism normally begin to decompose shortly after death. Death is an inevitable, universal process that eventually occurs in all living organisms. Death is generally applied to whole organisms; the similar process seen in individual components of a living organism, such as cells or tissues, is necrosis. Something that is not considered a living organism, such as a virus, can be physically destroyed but is not said to die. As of the early 21st century, over 150,000 humans die each day.Many cultures and religions have the idea of an afterlife, and also may hold the idea of judgement of good and bad deeds in one's life (Heaven -"

The instructor halted, expecting a query from the class about Heaven or some other topic.

The class stifled their yawns.

The educator carried on.

The professor noted mechanically, "- Heaven, Hell, Karma). The concept of death is a key to human understanding of the phenomenon. There are many scientific approaches and various interpretations of the concept. Additionally, the advent of life-sustaining therapy and the numerous criteria for defining death from both a medical and legal standpoint, have made it difficult to create a single unifying definition. One of the challenges in defining death is in distinguishing it from life. As a point in time, death would seem to refer to the moment at which life ends. Determining when death has occurred is difficult, as cessation of life functions is often not simultaneous across organ systems. Such determination, therefore, requires drawing precise conceptual boundaries between life and death. This is difficult, due to there being little consensus on how to define life. It is possible to define life in terms of consciousness. When consciousness ceases, a living organism can be said to have died. One of the flaws in this approach is that there are many organisms that are alive but probably not conscious (for example, single-celled organisms). Another problem is in defining consciousness, which has many different definitions given by modern scientists, psychologists and philosophers. Additionally, many religious traditions, including Abrahamic and Dharmic traditions, hold that death does not (or may not) entail the end of consciousness. In certain cultures, death is more of a process than a single event. It implies a slow shift from one spiritual state to another.Other definitions for death focus on the character of cessation of something. More specifically, death occurs when a living entity experiences irreversible cessation of all functioning. As it pertains to human life, death is an irreversible process where someone loses their existence as a person.Historically, attempts to define the exact moment of a human's death have been subjective, or imprecise. Death was once defined as the cessation of heartbeat (cardiac arrest) and of breathing, but the development of CPR and prompt defibrillation have rendered that definition inadequate because breathing and heartbeat can sometimes be restarted. This type of death where circulatory and respiratory arrest happens is known as the circulatory definition of death (DCDD). Proponents of the DCDD believe that this definition is reasonable because a person with permanent loss of circulatory and respiratory function should be considered dead. Critics of this definition state that while cessation of these functions may be permanent, it does not mean the situation is irreversible, because if CPR was applied, the person could be revived. Thus, the arguments for and against the DCDD boil down to a matter of defining the actual words 'permanent' and 'irreversible,' which further complicates the challenge of defining death. Furthermore, events which were causally linked to death in the past no longer kill in all circumstances; without a functioning heart or lungs, life can sometimes be sustained with a combination of life support devices, organ transplants and artificial pacemakers. Today, where a definition of the moment of death is required, doctors and coroners usually turn to 'brain death' or 'biological death' to define a person as being dead; people are considered dead when the electrical activity in their brain ceases. It is presumed that an end of electrical activity indicates the end of consciousness. Suspension of consciousness must be permanent, and not transient, as occurs during certain sleep stages, and especially a coma. In the case of sleep, EEGs can easily tell the difference. The category of 'brain death' is seen as problematic by some scholars. For instance, Dr. Franklin Miller, senior faculty member at the Department of Bioethics, National Institutes of Health, notes: 'By the late 1990s... the equation of brain death with death of the human being was increasingly challenged by scholars, based on evidence regarding the array of biological functioning displayed by patients correctly diagnosed as having this condition who were maintained on mechanical ventilation for substantial periods of time. These patients maintained the ability to sustain circulation and respiration, control temperature, excrete wastes, heal wounds, fight infections and, most dramatically, to gestate fetuses (in the case of pregnant 'brain-dead' women).'While 'brain death' is viewed as problematic by some scholars, there are certainly proponents of it that believe this definition of death is the most reasonable for distinguishing life from death. The reasoning behind the support for this definition is that brain death has a set of criteria that is reliable and reproducible. Also, the brain is crucial in determining our identity or who we are as human beings. The distinction should be made that 'brain death' cannot be equated with one who is in a vegetative state or coma, in that the former situation describes a state that is beyond recovery.Those people maintaining that only the neo-cortex of the brain is necessary for consciousness sometimes argue that only electrical activity should be considered when defining death. Eventually it is possible that the criterion for death will be the permanent and irreversible loss of cognitive function, as evidenced by the death of the cerebral cortex. All hope of recovering human thought and personality is then gone given current and foreseeable medical technology. At present, in most places the more conservative definition of death – irreversible cessation of electrical activity in the whole brain, as opposed to just in the neo-cortex – has been adopted (for example the Uniform Determination Of Death Act -"

"What's Uniform Determination Of Death Act?" a student raised mechanically.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The instructor sang calmly, "The Uniform Determination of Death -"

"What's Death?" a girl demanded sadly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The professor muttered calmly, "Death is the permanent, irreversible cessation of all biological functions that sustain a living organism. Brain death -"

The schoolteacher breathed carefully, "- Iron Age is the final epoch of the three-age division of the prehistory and protohistory of humanity. It was preceded by the Bronze -"

"Who's Bronze?" a girl raised furiously.

The educator acknowledged the query with a nod.

The educator murmured gingerly, "Bronze is an alloy consisting primarily of copper, commonly with about 12–12.5% tin and often with the addition of other metals (such as aluminium, manganese, nickel or zinc) and sometimes non-metals or metalloids such as arsenic, phosphorus or silicon. These additions produce a range of alloys that may be harder than copper alone, or have other useful properties, such as strength, ductility, or machinability. The archaeological period in which bronze was the hardest metal in widespread use is known as the Bronze Age -"

The professor acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The lecturer said robotically, "The Bronze Age is a historic period, approximately 3300 BCE to 1200 BCE, that was characterized by the use of bronze, in some areas proto-writing, and other early features of urban civilization. The Bronze Age is the second principal period of the three-age Stone-Bronze-Iron -"

The teacher looked around, waiting for a question from the pupils about Iron or some other topic.

The class sniggered.

The schoolteacher continued.

The professor declared excitedly, "- Iron system, as proposed in modern times by Christian Jürgensen Thomsen, for classifying and studying ancient societies and history. An ancient civilization is deemed to be part of the Bronze Age because it either produced bronze by smelting its own copper and alloying it with tin, arsenic, or other metals, or traded other items for bronze from production areas elsewhere. Bronze was harder and more durable than other metals available at the time, allowing Bronze Age civilizations to gain a technological advantage. While terrestrial iron is naturally abundant, its high melting point of 1,538 °C (2,800 °F) placed it out of reach of common use until the end of the second millennium BCE. Tin's low melting point of 231.9 °C (449.4 °F) and copper's relatively moderate melting point of 1,085 °C (1,985 °F) placed them within the capabilities of the Neolithic -"

"What's Neolithic?" a boy quizzed timidly.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The professor murmured gingerly, "The Neolithic period is the final division of the Stone Age, with a wide-ranging set of developments that appear to have arisen independently in several parts of the world. It is first seen about 12,000 years ago when the first developments of farming appeared in the Epipalaeolithic -"

"What's Epipalaeolithic?" a boy raised furiously.

"What's Chalcolithic?" a boy raised timidly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The lecturer noted calmly, "The Chalcolithic (English: ), a name derived from the Greek: χαλκός khalkós, 'copper' and from λίθος líthos, 'stone' or Copper -"

# Lesson 13: Laetare Sunday

"Good morning, class! Today we'll be studying Laetare Sunday," the lecturer sang quickly.

The class sniggered.

The lecturer elaborated confidently, "Laetare Sunday (/liːˈtɛːri/ or /lʌɪˈtɑːri/) is the fourth Sunday in the season of Lent -"

"What's Lent?" a pupil demanded sullenly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a smile.

The professor paid no heed to the interruption and carried on.

The teacher sang mechanically, "- Lent, in the Western Christian liturgical calendar. Traditionally, this Sunday has been a day of celebration, within the austere period of Lent. This Sunday gets its name from the first few words (incipit) of the traditional Latin entrance (Introit -"

The professor looked around, expecting a question from the students about Introit or some other topic.

The educator carried on.

The lecturer announced confidently, "- Introit) for the Mass of the day. 'Laetare Jerusalem' ('Rejoice, O Jerusalem') is Latin from Isaiah 66 -"

The schoolteacher paused, waiting for a query from the class about Isaiah 66 or some other topic.

The students watched quietly.

The professor carried on.

The educator muttered quietly, "- Isaiah 66:10. The term 'Laetare Sunday' is used by most Roman Catholic, Lutheran and Anglican churches. The word comes from the Latin laetare, the singular imperative of laetari: 'to rejoice'. The full Introit reads: Laetare Jerusalem et conventum facite omnes qui diligitis eam; gaudete cum laetitia, qui in tristitia fuistis, ut exsultetis et satiemini ab uberibus consolationis vestrae. Psalm: Laetatus sum in his quae dicta sunt mihi: in domum Domini ibimus. Rejoice ye with Jerusalem; and be ye glad for her, all ye that delight in her: exult and sing for joy with her, all ye that in sadness mourn for her; that ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations. Psalm: I was glad -"

The educator looked around, waiting for a query from the pupils about I was glad or some other topic.

The class sniggered.

The schoolteacher continued.

The lecturer noted quickly, "- I was glad when they said unto me, We will go into the house of the Lord. This Sunday is currently also known as Mothering Sunday -"

The instructor took a breath, listening for a query from the class about Mothering Sunday or some other topic.

The students suppressed giggles.

The instructor proceeded.

The lecturer said aggressively, "- Mothering Sunday, Refreshment Sunday, mid-Lent Sunday (in French mi-carême) and Rose Sunday (either because the golden rose (sent by Popes to Catholic sovereigns) used to be blessed at this time, or because the use of rose-colored (rather than violet) vestments was permitted on this day). Historically, the day was also known as 'the Sunday of the Five Loaves,' from the story of the miracle of the loaves and fishes. Before the adoption of the modern 'common lectionaries', this narrative was the traditional Gospel reading for this Sunday in Roman Catholic, Lutheran, Anglican, and Old Catholic churches. The station church at Rome for this day was Santa Croce in Gerusalemme -"

The teacher paused, expecting a question from the class about Santa Croce in Gerusalemme or some other topic.

The teacher carried on.

The educator said excitedly, "- Santa Croce in Gerusalemme, one of the seven chief basilicas; the Golden Rose -"

The lecturer looked around, listening for a question from the students about Golden Rose or some other topic.

The class listened in rapt attention.

The teacher carried on.

The teacher declared breathlessly, "- Golden Rose, sent by Popes to Catholic sovereigns, used to be blessed at this time and for this reason the day was sometimes called Dominica de Rosa. On Mothering Sunday, Christians have historically visited their mother church—the church in which they received the sacrament of baptism.In Roman Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran and Old Catholic churches flowers may appear on the high altar and the organ may be played as a solo instrument. Priests are given the option to wear rose-colored vestments at Mass held on this day in place of the violet vestments normally worn during Lent. The term 'rose' is used to describe this lighter shade of the color violet in the Roman Rite.The Sunday is considered a day of relaxation from normal Lenten rigours; a day of hope with Easter at last within sight. Traditionally, weddings (otherwise banned during Lent) could be performed on this day, and servants were released from service for the day to visit their mother church, the place in which they received the sacrament of baptism (hence 'Mothering Sunday'). Laetare Sunday is the date on which the recipient of University of Notre Dame's Laetare Medal -"

The professor took a breath, anticipating a question from the students about Laetare Medal or some other topic.

The class sniggered.

The schoolteacher carried on.

The teacher muttered breathlessly, "- Laetare Medal is announced. Laetare Sunday is exactly 21 days before Easter Sunday -"

The teacher paused, anticipating a question from the students about Easter Sunday or some other topic.

The pupils watched quietly.

The professor proceeded.

The educator muttered aggressively, "- Easter Sunday, a moveable feast based on the cycles of the moon. The date can be any between 1 March and 4 April inclusive; occurrence in April is considered to be uncommon; the last occurrence was on 3 April 2011 and the next will be on 4 April 2038, after which it will not occur again until 1 April 2057 – occurrences in April are printed in the below list in bold type. The earliest occurrence of Laetare Sunday in the twenty-first century was on 2 March 2008, and the latest will be on 4 April 2038. Laetare Sunday occurs on these dates: Gaudete Sunday -"

The professor stopped, expecting a question from the pupils about Gaudete Sunday or some other topic.

The pupils sat straighter in their seats.

The instructor carried on.

The bell sounded.

"That's all the time we have. I hope you learned something today," the schoolteacher sang excitedly.

The class left the room sadly.

"Welcome, class! Today we'll be studying Mezhdurechye," the educator noted gently.

The class suppressed giggles.

The professor said pointedly, "Mezhdurechye (Russia -"

"What's Russia?" a girl quizzed furiously.

The schoolteacher ignored the interruption and proceeded.

The schoolteacher muttered slowly, "- Russian: Междуречье) is the name of several rural localities in Russia: Mezhdurechye, Biysky District, Altai Krai -"

The schoolteacher halted, listening for a question from the students about Mezhdurechye, Biysky District, Altai Krai or some other topic.

"What's Mezhdurechye, Loktevsky District, Altai Krai?" a girl raised mechanically.

The schoolteacher announced politely, "Mezhdurechye (Russia -"

"What's Russia?" a girl raised pointedly.

The instructor acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The lecturer sang carefully, "Russia (Russian: Россия, Rossiya, Russian pronunciation: [rɐˈsʲijə]), or the Russian Federation -"

"What's Federation?" a pupil queried timidly.

The professor acknowledged the query with a smile.

The schoolteacher seethed crudely, "A federation (also known as a federal state) is a political entity characterized by a union of partially self-governing provinces, states, or other regions under a central federal government (federalism). In a federation, the self-governing status of the component states, as well as the division of power between them and the central government, is typically constitutionally entrenched and may not be altered by a unilateral decision of either party, the states or the federal political body. Alternatively, a federation is a form of government in which sovereign power is formally divided between a central authority and a number of constituent regions so that each region retains some degree of control over its internal affairs. It is often argued that federal states where the central government has overriding powers are not truly federal states. For example, such overriding powers may include: the constitutional authority to suspend a constituent state's government by invoking gross mismanagement or civil unrest, or to adopt national legislation that overrides or infringes on the constituent states' powers by invoking the central government's constitutional authority to ensure 'peace and good government' or to implement obligations contracted under an international treaty. The governmental or constitutional structure found in a federation is considered to be federalist, or to be an example of federalism. It can be considered the opposite of another system, the unitary state. France -"

"What's France?" a boy demanded happily.

The professor acknowledged the query with a grin.

The lecturer elaborated furiously, "France (French: [fʁɑ̃s] ), officially the French Republic -"

"What's French Republic?" a boy interjected sullenly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the query with a nod.

The teacher said gingerly, "France (French: [fʁɑ̃s] ), officially the French Republic -"

"What's French Republic?" a boy said timidly.

The educator acknowledged the question with a nervous laugh.

The instructor seethed crudely, "France (French: [fʁɑ̃s] ), officially the French Republic -"

"What's French Republic?" a pupil queried robotically.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a nervous laugh.

The instructor said robotically, "France (French: [fʁɑ̃s] ), officially the French Republic -"

The professor paused, waiting for a question from the students about French Republic or some other topic.

The students stifled their yawns.

The teacher carried on.

The professor murmured happily, "- French Republic -"

"What's Republic?" a boy piped up sadly.

The educator acknowledged the question with a grin.

The professor said carefully, "A republic (from Latin res publica 'public affair') is a form of government in which 'power is held by the people and their elected representatives'. In republics, the country is considered a 'public matter', not the private concern or property of the rulers. The primary positions of power within a republic are attained through democracy or a mix of democracy with oligarchy or autocracy rather than being unalterably occupied by any given family lineage or group. With modern republicanism, it has become the opposing form of government to a monarchy and therefore a modern republic has no monarch as head of state.As of 2017, 159 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word 'republic' as part of their official names. Not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor is the word 'republic' used in the names of all states with elected governments. The word republic comes from the Latin term res publica, which literally means 'public thing', 'public matter', or 'public affair' and was used to refer to the state as a whole. The term developed its modern meaning in reference to the constitution of the ancient Roman Republic, lasting from the overthrow of the kings in 509 BC to the establishment of the Empire -"

"What's Empire?" a pupil demanded carefully.

The educator acknowledged the query with a smile.

The teacher noted crudely, "An empire is a sovereign state made up of several territories and peoples subject to a single ruling authority, often an emperor. A state can become an empire either by a narrow definition through having an emperor and being named as such, or by a broad definition as stated above as an aggregate territory under the rule of supreme authorities such as the Roman Empire -"

The professor stopped, anticipating a query from the class about Roman Empire or some other topic.

The pupils listened in rapt attention.

The instructor proceeded.

The professor muttered carefully, "- Roman Empire. An empire can be made solely of contiguous territories, such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire -"

The teacher looked around, expecting a query from the pupils about Austro-Hungarian Empire or some other topic.

The pupils listened in rapt attention.

The instructor continued.

The schoolteacher breathed pointedly, "- Austro-Hungarian Empire or the Russia -"

The professor paused, listening for a question from the class about Russia or some other topic.

The students sat straighter in their seats.

The professor proceeded.

"Now then, turning back our attention to Republic....", the lecturer declared happily.

The class sniggered.

"Okay, returning to France....", the schoolteacher explained sullenly.

The students watched quietly.

The class watched quietly.

"Well then, turning back our attention to Russia....", the instructor announced quickly.

The class stifled their yawns.

"Well then, back again to Mezhdurechye, Loktevsky District, Altai Krai....", the teacher declared slowly.

The class sat straighter in their seats.

"So, going back to Mezhdurechye....", the lecturer noted pointedly.

The students suppressed giggles.

The teacher announced crudely, "- Mezhdurechye, Loktevsky District -"

The schoolteacher looked around, expecting a query from the students about Loktevsky District or some other topic.

The teacher carried on.

The schoolteacher declared timidly, "- Loktevsky District, Altai Krai, a settlement in Vtorokamensky Selsoviet of Loktevsky District in Altai Krai; 51°6′N 81°46′E Mezhdurechye, Chuvash Republic -"

"What's Mezhdurechye, Chuvash Republic?" a girl quizzed slowly.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a nervous laugh.

The professor muttered gently, "Mezhdurechye (Russia -"

"What's Russia?" a pupil interjected excitedly.

It is located in the east of the krai and borders with Zonalny, Tselinny, Soltonsky, Krasnogorsky, Sovetsky, and Smolensky Districts, as well as with the territory of the City of Biysk.

Biysky District is located in the eastern part of the krai, in the southern part of Biysko-Chumyshskaya Highland. The terrain is rugged and people extract sand and gravel. The Biya, Katun, Bekhtemir, Shubenka, and Nenya Rivers flow through the district. Pines, birches, aspens, alders, sorbus, viburnum, bird cherries, and poplar grow in this area. The district was established on May 27, 1924 as one of the eighteen districts comprising Biysky Uyezd -"

"Who's Biysky Uyezd?" a student interjected quickly.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a smile.

The educator ignored the interruption and carried on.

The professor explained breathlessly, "- Biysky Uyezd of Altai Governorate -"

"What's Altai Governorate?" a boy queried sadly.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a smile.

The instructor muttered crudely, "Vera Sergeyevna Kashcheyeva (Russian: Вера Сергеевна Кащеева; 15 September 1922 – 20 May 1975) was a medic in the 120th Rifle Regiment who was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union -"

The educator stopped, anticipating a question from the class about Hero of the Soviet Union or some other topic.

The lecturer continued.

The instructor declared slowly, "- Hero of the Soviet Union -"

"What's Soviet Union?" a pupil queried sullenly.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The professor seethed crudely, "The Soviet Union, officially the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), was a socialist state that spanned Europe and Asia during its existence from 1922 to 1991. It was nominally a federal union of multiple national republics; in practice its government and economy were highly centralized until its final years. The country was a one-party state (prior to 1990) governed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, with Moscow -"

The teacher halted, waiting for a question from the pupils about Moscow or some other topic.

The class sat straighter in their seats.

The lecturer continued.

The schoolteacher seethed calmly, "- Moscow as its capital within its largest and most populous republic, the Russian SFSR -"

The lecturer elaborated timidly, "Europe is a continent located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere -"

The teacher stopped, listening for a query from the pupils about South America or some other topic.

The teacher proceeded.

The lecturer sang sullenly, "- South America and the surrounding waters. Longitudes 20°W and 160°E are often considered its boundaries.' It may be used in a cultural or geopolitical sense as a synonym for the 'New World -"

"What's New World?" a student interjected timidly.

The educator acknowledged the question with a nervous laugh.

The schoolteacher seethed sadly, "The 'New World -"

"What's World?" a girl asked gingerly.

The instructor acknowledged the question with a nervous laugh.

The lecturer said sadly, "In its most general sense, the term 'world' refers to the totality of entities, to the whole of reality or to everything that is. The nature of the world has been conceptualized differently in different fields. Some conceptions see the world as unique while others talk of a 'plurality of worlds'. Some treat the world as one simple object while others analyze the world as a complex made up of many parts. In scientific cosmology the world or universe is commonly defined as '[t]he totality of all space and time; all that is, has been, and will be'. Theories of modality, on the other hand, talk of possible worlds as complete and consistent ways how things could have been. Phenomenology, starting from the horizon of co-given objects present in the periphery of every experience, defines the world as the biggest horizon or the 'horizon of all horizons'. In philosophy of mind, the world is commonly contrasted with the mind as that which is represented by the mind. Theology conceptualizes the world in relation to God, for example, as God's creation, as identical to God or as the two being interdependent. In religions, there is often a tendency to downgrade the material or sensory world in favor of a spiritual world to be sought through religious practice. A comprehensive representation of the world and our place in it, as is commonly found in religions, is known as a worldview. Cosmogony -"

The teacher paused, listening for a question from the pupils about Cosmogony or some other topic.

The class stifled their yawns.

The lecturer continued.

The pupils sat straighter in their seats.

The professor seethed calmly, "A republic (from Latin res publica 'public affair') is a form of government in which 'power is held by the people and their elected representatives'. In republics, the country is considered a 'public matter', not the private concern or property of the rulers. The primary positions of power within a republic are attained through democracy or a mix of democracy with oligarchy or autocracy rather than being unalterably occupied by any given family lineage or group. With modern republicanism, it has become the opposing form of government to a monarchy and therefore a modern republic has no monarch as head of state.As of 2017, 159 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word 'republic' as part of their official names. Not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor is the word 'republic' used in the names of all states with elected governments. The word republic comes from the Latin term res publica, which literally means 'public thing', 'public matter', or 'public affair' and was used to refer to the state as a whole. The term developed its modern meaning in reference to the constitution of the ancient Roman Republic -"

The schoolteacher paused, anticipating a question from the pupils about Roman Republic or some other topic.

The schoolteacher continued.

The instructor explained aggressively, "- Roman Republic, lasting from the overthrow of the kings in 509 BC to the establishment of the Empire -"

"What's Empire?" a pupil queried happily.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The schoolteacher elaborated furiously, "An empire is a sovereign state made up of several territories and peoples subject to a single ruling authority, often an emperor. A state can become an empire either by a narrow definition through having an emperor and being named as such, or by a broad definition as stated above as an aggregate territory under the rule of supreme authorities such as the Roman Empire. An empire can be made solely of contiguous territories, such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire or the Russian Empire, or include territories which are far remote from the 'home' country of the empire, such as a colonial empire. Aside from the more formal usage, the word empire can also refer colloquially to a large-scale business enterprise (e.g. a transnational corporation), a political organisation controlled by a single individual (a political boss), or a group (political bosses). The concept of empire is associated with other such concepts as imperialism, colonialism, and globalization, with imperialism referring to the creation and maintenance of unequal relationships between nations and not necessarily the policy of a state headed by an emperor or empress. Empire is often used as a term to describe displeasure to overpowering situations.There are two main ways to establish and maintain an imperial political structure: (i) as a territorial empire of direct conquest and control with force or (ii) as a coercive, hegemonic empire of indirect conquest and control with power. The former method provides greater tribute and direct political control, yet limits further expansion because it absorbs military forces to fixed garrisons. The latter method provides less tribute and indirect control, but avails military forces for further expansion. Territorial empires (e.g. the Macedonian Empire and Byzantine Empire -"

"What's Byzantine Empire?" a girl quizzed sullenly.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a smile.

The educator announced confidently, "The Byzantine Empire -"

"What's Empire?" a boy asked gently.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a nod.

The lecturer announced gingerly, "An empire is a sovereign state made up of several territories and peoples subject to a single ruling authority, often an emperor. A state can become an empire either by a narrow definition through having an emperor and being named as such, or by a broad definition as stated above as an aggregate territory under the rule of supreme authorities such as the Roman Empire -"

The lecturer stopped, listening for a question from the students about Roman Empire or some other topic.

The teacher continued.

The professor muttered sadly, "- Roman Empire. An empire can be made solely of contiguous territories, such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire -"

"What's Austro-Hungarian Empire?" a girl said furiously.

The teacher paid no attention to the interruption and carried on.

The teacher breathed carefully, "- Austro-Hungarian Empire or the Russia -"

The professor took a breath, anticipating a question from the pupils about Russia or some other topic.

The class watched quietly.

The professor proceeded.

The schoolteacher elaborated patiently, "- Russian Empire, or include territories which are far remote from the 'home' country of the empire, such as a colonial empire.

The educator looked around, expecting a query from the students about Byzantine Empire or some other topic.

The pupils sat straighter in their seats.

The instructor carried on.

"Well then, getting back to Byzantine Empire....", the schoolteacher declared timidly.

The class stifled their yawns.

"Now then, turning back our attention to Empire....", the instructor breathed slowly.

The pupils suppressed giggles.

"Okay, getting back to Republic....", the instructor murmured excitedly.

The class sat straighter in their seats.

"Now, returning to France....", the teacher breathed slowly.

The pupils watched quietly.

"Now then, turning back our attention to France....", the teacher explained sadly.

The class sat straighter in their seats.

"So, going back to Vierzon....", the instructor breathed aggressively.

The students sat straighter in their seats.

"Now then, getting back to Édouard Vaillant....", the schoolteacher announced furiously.

The pupils watched quietly.

"Okay, getting back to French Section of the Workers' International....", the instructor announced happily.

The students sniggered.

"Alright, back again to Roger Salengro....", the schoolteacher said happily.

The class listened in rapt attention.

The bell sounded.

"That's all the time we have. I hope you learned something today," the educator breathed slowly.

The class vacated the room confidently.

# Lesson 16: Crazy Little Thing Called Love

"Hello and welcome, class! Today we'll be discussing Crazy Little Thing Called Love," the lecturer sang happily.

The class listened in rapt attention.

The professor said sullenly, "'Crazy Little Thing Called Love' is a song by the British rock band Queen. Written by Freddie Mercury -"

The teacher took a breath, listening for a question from the class about Freddie Mercury or some other topic.

The pupils suppressed giggles.

The educator proceeded.

The teacher said timidly, "- Freddie Mercury in 1979, the track is included on their 1980 album The Game, and also appears on the band's compilation album, Greatest Hits in 1981. The song peaked at number two in the UK Singles Chart in 1979, and became the group's first number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US in 1980, remaining there for four consecutive weeks. It topped the Australian ARIA Charts -"

The professor took a breath, waiting for a question from the pupils about ARIA Charts or some other topic.

The pupils sniggered.

The professor continued.

The instructor sang happily, "- ARIA Charts for seven weeks. It was the band's final single release of the 1970s. Having composed 'Crazy Little Thing Called Love' on guitar, Mercury played rhythm guitar while performing the song live, which was the first time he played guitar in concert with Queen. Queen played the song live between 1979 and 1986, and a live performance of the song is recorded in the albums Queen Rock Montreal -"

The lecturer halted, expecting a question from the class about Queen Rock Montreal or some other topic.

The lecturer continued.

The teacher elaborated happily, "- Queen Rock Montreal, Queen on Fire – Live at the Bowl -"

"What's Queen on Fire – Live at the Bowl?" a student piped up pointedly.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The lecturer murmured confidently, "Queen on Fire – Live at the Bowl is a live album/DVD -"

The teacher looked around, waiting for a query from the class about DVD or some other topic.

The class stifled their yawns.

The educator continued.

The educator said politely, "- DVD by the British rock band Queen released on 25 October 2004 in Europe and on 9 November 2004 in the US. It was recorded live at the Milton Keynes -"

The professor halted, waiting for a question from the class about Milton Keynes or some other topic.

The pupils sniggered.

The educator continued.

The educator seethed gingerly, "- Milton Keynes Bowl -"

The professor looked around, waiting for a query from the class about Milton Keynes Bowl or some other topic.

The lecturer continued.

The teacher explained quietly, "- Milton Keynes Bowl, Buckinghamshire -"

The educator stopped, waiting for a query from the class about Buckinghamshire or some other topic.

The teacher continued.

The schoolteacher explained furiously, "- Buckinghamshire, England, on 5 June 1982 during the Hot Space -"

The teacher paused, anticipating a question from the class about Hot Space or some other topic.

The pupils stifled their yawns.

The educator proceeded.

The lecturer explained robotically, "- Hot Space Tour. A DVD was also released with the complete concert and bonus material, such as band interviews and tour highlights. In 2005, the album was also released as an LP. In the UK, the CD made No. 20 and DVD No. 1 in the CD and DVD chart respectively. In the US, neither the album nor the DVD charted. During the show, lead guitarist Brian May -"

The teacher looked around, listening for a query from the class about Brian May or some other topic.

The pupils watched quietly.

The lecturer carried on.

The lecturer elaborated patiently, "- Brian May -"

The professor halted, listening for a question from the pupils about May or some other topic.

The teacher proceeded.

The educator murmured mechanically, "- May had a few minor problems with his homemade Red Special -"

"What's Red Special?" a pupil wondered gently.

The professor acknowledged the query with a smile.

The teacher breathed excitedly, "The Red Special is the electric guitar designed and built by Queen's guitarist Brian May and his father, Harold, when Brian was a teenager in the early 1960s. The Red Special is sometimes referred to as the Fireplace or the Old Lady by May and by others. The name Red Special came from the reddish-brown colour the guitar attained after being stained and painted with numerous layers of Rustins Plastic Coating. The name Fireplace is a reference to the fact that the wood used to make the neck came from a fireplace mantel.A guitar that would define May's signature style, it was intentionally designed to feed back after he saw Jeff Beck -"

The educator stopped, waiting for a question from the class about Jeff Beck or some other topic.

The pupils listened in rapt attention.

The schoolteacher carried on.

The lecturer muttered slowly, "- Jeff Beck playing live and making different sounds just by moving the guitar in front of the amplifier. He wanted an instrument that would be alive and interact with him and the air around him. May has used the Red Special almost exclusively, including on Queen albums and in live performances, since the band's advent in the early 1970s. In celebration of the instrument's 50th anniversary, a book about its construction and history, Brian May’s Red Special: The Story of the Home-Made Guitar that Rocked Queen and the World, was written by Brian May with Simon Bradley. Unlike the primary instruments of most musicians, the Red Special was built by its player, May, along with his father. The inspiration struck when May realized he could not afford a Fender, Gibson or Höfner guitar. They began to work on the guitar in August 1963, with the project being finished in October 1964. The neck was constructed from wood from a 'hundred-year-old-ish' fireplace mantel that a friend of the family was about to throw away. The neck was hand-shaped into the desired form, a job that was made more difficult by the age and quality of the wood. According to May, there are worm holes in the neck of the guitar that he filled in with matchsticks.The neck was finished with a 24-fret oak fingerboard. Each of the position inlays was hand shaped from a mother-of-pearl button. May decided to position them in a personal way: two dots at the 7th and 19th fret and three at the 12th and 24th. The body was made from blockboard (strips of softwood sandwiched between two plywood skins) with oak inserts in the top and bottom layers sourced from an old table. It was covered with mahogany marquetry veneer on the top, bottom and side to give it the appearance of a solid-body guitar. It was originally intended that the guitar would have f-holes but this was never done. White plastic shelf edging was then applied to the top and bottom edges to protect them from damage. The guitar features three single-coil pick-ups and a custom-made aluminium bridge. May purchased a set of Burns Tri-Sonic -"

The professor stopped, expecting a query from the pupils about Burns Tri-Sonic or some other topic.

The students suppressed giggles.

The instructor continued.

The teacher announced crudely, "- Burns Tri-Sonic pick-ups and covered the coils of two with Araldite -"

The lecturer paused, listening for a query from the students about Araldite or some other topic.

The educator continued.

The instructor elaborated calmly, "- Araldite epoxy to reduce microphonics. The middle pickup remained uncoated and this is understood to have been modified in the early 1980s when DiMarzio -"

The lecturer took a breath, anticipating a query from the students about DiMarzio or some other topic.

The pupils sniggered.

The instructor proceeded.

The educator sang confidently, "- DiMarzio examined the Red Special when designing pickups for the first Guild replica. The magnet was turned over to change its polarity and the wires on the solder posts swapped (to mimic a reverse wound coil) which made his favoured pickup combination of bridge and middle in phase humbucking. He originally wound his own pick-ups, as he had for his first guitar, but he did not like the resulting sound because of the polarity of these pick-ups: alternating North-South instead of all North. The tremolo system is made from an old hardened-steel knife-edge shaped into a V and two motorbike valve springs to counter the 79 pounds (36 kg) string tension. The tension of the springs can be adjusted by screwing the bolts, which run through the middle of the springs, in or out via two small access holes next to the rear strap button. To reduce friction, the bridge was completed with rollers to allow the strings to return perfectly in tune after using the tremolo arm (the arm itself was from a bicycle saddlebag holder with a plastic knitting needle tip). For the same reason, at the other end of the neck the strings pass over a zero fret and through a bakelite string guide. Originally the guitar had a built-in distortion circuit, adapted from a mid-1960s Vox distortion effects unit. The switch for this was in front of the phase switches. May soon discovered that he preferred the sound of a Vox AC30 -"

"What's Vox AC30?" a student demanded crudely.

The professor acknowledged the question with a nod.

The schoolteacher disregarded the interruption and carried on.

The educator elaborated furiously, "- Vox AC30 distorting at full power, so the circuit was removed. The switch hole is now covered by a mother-of-pearl star inlay, but was originally covered by insulation tape. May still uses the original but he has used replicas in some performances. Notably, the original guitar was not used in the videos 'We Will Rock You', and 'Spread Your Wings -"

"What's Spread Your Wings?" a boy piped up robotically.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a smirk.

The educator seethed happily, "'Spread Your Wings' is a power ballad by the rock band Queen, from their 1977 album News of the World. Written by bassist John Deacon -"

The teacher paused, waiting for a question from the students about John Deacon or some other topic.

The pupils sniggered.

The lecturer carried on.

The educator noted quietly, "- John Deacon, it was released as the A-side of the single 'Spread Your Wings'/'Sheer Heart Attack -"

The educator looked around, expecting a query from the pupils about Sheer Heart Attack or some other topic.

The students sniggered.

The educator continued.

The instructor seethed sullenly, "- Sheer Heart Attack' in 1978. The track features Freddie Mercury on piano and vocals, Brian May on electric guitar, Roger Taylor on drums, and John Deacon on bass and acoustic guitars. A live version of the song appears on the band's 1979 album Live Killers -"

The instructor halted, listening for a query from the class about Live Killers or some other topic.

The students sat straighter in their seats.

The instructor proceeded.

The educator said furiously, "- Live Killers. The song peaked at number 34 in the UK Singles Chart -"

The professor took a breath, listening for a query from the class about UK Singles Chart or some other topic.

The class watched quietly.

The educator continued.

The lecturer murmured quietly, "- UK Singles Chart. 'Spread Your Wings' was not released as a single in North America. However, the live version from Live Killers was featured as the B-side to Queen's 1979 hit, 'Crazy Little Thing Called Love -"

The schoolteacher stopped, waiting for a question from the class about Crazy Little Thing Called Love or some other topic.

The students sat straighter in their seats.

The schoolteacher continued.

The educator sang calmly, "- Crazy Little Thing Called Love', which reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 -"

"What's Billboard Hot 100?" a student interjected quickly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the query with a nervous laugh.

The professor noted crudely, "The Billboard Hot 100 -"

The teacher halted, waiting for a query from the students about Hot 100 or some other topic.

The pupils watched quietly.

The lecturer carried on.

The teacher breathed confidently, "- Hot 100 is the music industry standard record chart in the United States for songs, published weekly by Billboard magazine. Chart rankings are based on sales (physical and digital), radio play, and online streaming in the United States.The weekly tracking period for sales was initially Monday to Sunday when Nielsen started tracking sales in 1991, but was changed to Friday to Thursday in July 2015. This tracking period also applies to compiling online streaming data. Radio airplay, which, unlike sales figures and streaming, is readily available on a real-time basis, is also tracked on a Friday to Thursday cycle effective with the chart dated July 17, 2021 (previously Monday to Sunday and before July 2015, Wednesday to Tuesday). A new chart is compiled and officially released to the public by Billboard on Tuesdays but post-dated to the following Saturday. The first number one song of the Billboard Hot 100 was 'Poor Little Fool' by Ricky Nelson, on August 4, 1958. As of the issue for the week ending on November 13, 2021, the Billboard Hot 100 has had 1,131 different number one entries. The chart's current number-one song is 'Easy on Me -"

"What's Easy on Me?" a pupil said breathlessly.

The instructor acknowledged the question with a smile.

The professor announced patiently, "'Easy on Me' is a song by English singer-songwriter Adele -"

The professor looked around, anticipating a query from the pupils about Adele or some other topic.

The pupils stifled their yawns.

The lecturer continued.

The professor announced quickly, "- Adele released on 15 October 2021 through Columbia Records -"

"What's Columbia Records?" a girl said quickly.

The lecturer ignored the interruption and carried on.

The professor said quickly, "- Columbia Records as the lead single from her upcoming fourth studio album, 30 (2021). Her first single in nearly five years, 'Easy on Me' was produced by American record producer Greg Kurstin -"

The professor halted, anticipating a question from the students about Greg Kurstin or some other topic.

The teacher carried on.

The schoolteacher seethed gently, "- Greg Kurstin, who also co-wrote the song with Adele. A minimally produced ballad, the song is set to a prominent, sombre piano, propelled by sparse bass beats. Expressing themes of nostalgia, regret, and forgiveness, the song's lyrics represent Adele's plea to her son, in which she details her struggles with her dissolved marriage and requests him to be kind to her. Music critics reviewed the song positively, with praise towards its poignant lyrics and emotional vocals, though some opined it did not match the heights of her previous singles. Commercially, the song garnered the Spotify -"

The teacher took a breath, waiting for a question from the pupils about Spotify or some other topic.

The pupils watched quietly.

The educator carried on.

The teacher breathed politely, "- Spotify and Amazon Music records for the most streams for a song in a day or a week. It topped the charts in 25 countries, including the United Kingdom, and United States, marking her third and fifth chart toppers in the respective territories.An accompanying music video, directed by Canadian filmmaker Xavier Dolan -"

"Who's Xavier Dolan?" a student asked quietly.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

He began his career as a child actor in commercials before directing several arthouse feature films. He first received international acclaim in 2009 for his feature film directorial debut, I Killed My Mother -"

"What's I Killed My Mother?" a boy queried.

"What's Indian reservation?" a boy said quickly.

The professor acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The teacher noted timidly, "An Indian reservation is an area of land tenure governed by a federally recognized Native American tribal nation under the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs, rather than by the government of the state in which it is located. The 326 Indian reservations in the United States are associated with specific Native American nations, often on a one-to-one basis. Some of the country's 574 federally recognized tribes govern more than one reservation, while some share reservations, and others have no reservation at all. In addition, because of past land allotments, leading to sales to non–Native Americans, some reservations are severely fragmented, with each piece of tribal, individual, and privately held land being a separate enclave. This jumble of private and public real estate creates significant administrative, political and legal difficulties.The collective geographical area of all reservations is 56,200,000 acres (22,700,000 ha; 87,800 sq mi; 227,000 km2), approximately the size of the state of Idaho -"

The educator took a breath, expecting a query from the students about Idaho or some other topic.

The teacher paused, anticipating a query from the students about Navajo Nation or some other topic.

The professor murmured calmly, "- Navajo Nation Reservation, is similar in size to West Virginia. Reservations are unevenly distributed throughout the country; the majority are west of the Mississippi River -"

The educator looked around, waiting for a question from the class about Mississippi River or some other topic.

The pupils stifled their yawns.

The instructor carried on.

The professor muttered robotically, "- Mississippi River and occupy lands that were first reserved by treaty or 'granted' from the public domain.Because recognized Native American nations possess limited tribal sovereignty, laws on tribal lands vary from those of the surrounding area. For example, these laws can permit legal casinos on reservations located in states which do not allow gambling, attracting tourism. The tribal council, not the local government or the state or federal government, generally has jurisdiction over the reservation. Different reservations have different systems of government, which may or may not replicate the forms of government found outside the reservation. Most Native American reservations were established by the federal government; a limited number, mainly in the East, owe their origin to state recognition.The term 'reservation' is a legal designation. It comes from the conception of the Native American nations as independent sovereigns at the time the U.S. Constitution was ratified. Thus, early peace treaties (often signed under conditions of duress or fraud), in which Native American nations surrendered large portions of their land to the United States, designated parcels which the nations, as sovereigns, 'reserved' to themselves, and those parcels came to be called 'reservations'. The term remained in use after the federal government began to forcibly relocate nations to parcels of land to which they had no historical connection. Today a majority of Native Americans and Alaska Natives -"

The schoolteacher took a breath, anticipating a question from the class about Alaska Natives or some other topic.

The instructor carried on.

"What's Indian reservation?" a girl demanded calmly.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a nervous laugh.

The teacher sang sullenly, "An Indian reservation is an area of land tenure governed by a federally recognized Native American tribal nation under the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs -"

The instructor looked around, expecting a query from the pupils about Bureau of Indian Affairs or some other topic.

The class sniggered.

The instructor proceeded.

The instructor seethed breathlessly, "- Bureau of Indian Affairs, rather than by the government of the state in which it is located. The 326 Indian reservations in the United States -"

The teacher took a breath, expecting a question from the students about United States or some other topic.

The students stifled their yawns.

The educator carried on.

The professor elaborated pointedly, "- United States are associated with specific Native American nations, often on a one-to-one basis. Some of the country's 574 federally recognized tribes govern more than one reservation, while some share reservations, and others have no reservation at all. In addition, because of past land allotments, leading to sales to non–Native Americans, some reservations are severely fragmented, with each piece of tribal, individual, and privately held land being a separate enclave.

The instructor continued.

The lecturer explained furiously, "- Elwood Donaldson and George Thompson. Following meetings held at Spring Hill Farms, the FNM officially became a political party in October 1971, with Cecil Wallace Whitfield as its leader. The other group, the UBP, was one of the main political parties in the Bahamas and had governed the country since the advent of party politics in 1958, until it lost the 1967 general election by a paper thin margin to the Opposition PLP. The UBP party's leadership was predominantly white while blacks made up most of the citizenry. Once out of power, its leaders decided that the party's time was at an end and they looked to the Free-PLP to form a new party that would follow a conservative party line. The fusion was called the Free National Movement. The party grew in part by uniting independent black voters and the old UBP voter base. However, these were heady days for the governing PLP, who led the country to independence in 1973, and the FNM failed to gain much more than 40% of the vote in a string of general elections defeats. In 1990, Hubert Ingraham took over the leadership of the party after the death of Sir Cecil Wallace Whitfield. The FNM attacked the governing PLP on corruption charges and published a Manifesto. In the general election of 1992, the FNM defeated its rival, the PLP, by wide margins, winning 32 of the then 49 seats. The FNM Government privatized the government-owned hotels, which had fallen into decline since nationalization. Private radio stations were allowed to operate, ending the government's broadcast monopoly. The FNM also introduced local government and encouraged inward investment to grow the economy. The elections of 1997 saw the FNM re-elected in a landslide, with 35 of the 40 seats in a reduced House. After Ingraham vowed not to seek a third term in office, Tommy Turnquest -"

The instructor paused, anticipating a query from the students about Tommy Turnquest or some other topic.

The students listened in rapt attention.

The professor continued.

The schoolteacher elaborated gingerly, "- Tommy Turnquest was elected leader of the party. The party then lost the 2002 elections. Many voters, including FNM supporters, felt that Turnquest was much 'weaker' than Perry Christie, leader of the Progressive Liberal Party. At the FNM's party convention the following the general elections of 2002, Ingraham was returned as leader of the Free National Movement. The FNM went on to regain control of the House of Assembly in the elections of 2007.The FNM lost government to the Progressive Liberal Party once again in the 2012 Bahamian general election -"

The professor paused, expecting a question from the class about 2012 Bahamian general election or some other topic.

The students stifled their yawns.

The lecturer carried on.

"Now, turning back our attention to 2021 Bahamian general election....", the educator murmured sullenly.

# Lesson 23: Global surface temperature

"Welcome, class! Today we'll be covering Global surface temperature," the lecturer announced confidently.

The pupils stifled their yawns.

The professor said quickly, "In earth science, global surface temperature (GST; sometimes referred to as global mean surface temperature, GMST) is calculated by averaging the temperature at the surface of the sea and air temperature over land. In technical writing, scientists call long-term changes in GST global cooling or global warming. Periods of both have happened regularly throughout earth's history. Since the beginning of global temperatures in 1880 up to 1940, the average annual temperature has increased by 0.2 °C. The temperature was then stable between 1940 and 1970. And it has been increasing again since 1970 by 0.18 °C each decade. The average global temperature has increased by 0.9 °C (1.5 °F) compared to the baseline temperature which is about 14 °C. Although a pause has been observed between 1998 and 2013, the global warming continues since at the same pace as before. Scientists point out that in the earth's 4.6 billion years of history, sea levels have risen and fallen sharply. However, the recent global sea level rise rate has deviated from the average rate of the past two to three thousand years, and is rising at a rate of one-tenth of an inch per year. The continuation or acceleration of this trend may cause amazing changes in the world's coastlines. In the 1860s, physicist John Tyndall -"

The lecturer said sullenly, "Dark -"

"What's Dark?" a boy demanded calmly.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The professor ignored the interruption and carried on.

The schoolteacher noted gently, "- Darkness, the direct opposite of lightness, is defined as a lack of illumination, an absence of visible light, or a surface that absorbs light, such as black or brown. Human vision is unable to distinguish colors in conditions of very low luminance. This is because the hue sensitive photoreceptor cells on the retina are inactive when light levels are insufficient, in the range of visual perception referred to as scotopic vision. The emotional response to darkness has generated metaphorical usages of the term in many cultures, often used to describe an unhappy or foreboding feeling. Referring to a time of day, complete darkness occurs when the Sun -"

"What's Sun?" a boy demanded timidly.

The educator acknowledged the question with a smile.

The professor disregarded the interruption and continued.

The schoolteacher declared sullenly, "- Sun is more than 18° below the horizon, without the effects of twilight on the night sky. The perception of darkness differs from the mere absence of light due to the effects of after images on perception. In perceiving, the eye is active, and the part of the retina that is unstimulated produces a complementary afterimage. In terms of physics, an object is said to be dark when it absorbs photons, causing it to appear dim compared to other objects. For example, matte black paint does not reflect much visible light and appears dark, whereas white paint reflects much light and appears bright. For more information, see color. An object may appear dark, but it may be bright at a frequency that humans cannot perceive. A dark area has limited light sources, making things hard to see. Exposure to alternating light and darkness (night and day) has caused several evolutionary adaptations to darkness. When a vertebrate, like a human, enters a dark area, its pupils dilate, allowing more light to enter the eye and improving night vision. Also, the light detecting cells in the human eye (rods and cones) will regenerate more unbleached rhodopsin when adapting to darkness. One scientific measure of darkness is the Bortle Dark-Sky Scale -"

"What's Bortle Dark-Sky Scale?" a pupil asked sullenly.

The educator acknowledged the query with a nod.

The schoolteacher muttered aggressively, "The Bortle -"

The lecturer took a breath, waiting for a query from the class about Bortle or some other topic.

The lecturer stopped, listening for a question from the pupils about John E. Bortle or some other topic.

The students suppressed giggles.

The teacher continued.

The schoolteacher declared timidly, "- John E. Bortle created the scale and published it in the February 2001 edition of Sky & Telescope -"

"What's Sky & Telescope?" a boy raised furiously.

Institutions can refer to mechanisms which govern the behavior of a set of individuals within a given community, and are identified with a social purpose, transcending individuals and intentions by mediating the rules that govern living behavior. According to Geoffrey M. Hodgson, it is misleading to say that an institution is a form of behavior. Instead, Hodgson states that institutions are 'integrated systems of rules that structure social interactions'.The term 'institution' commonly applies to both informal institutions such as customs, or behavior patterns important to a society, and to particular formal institutions created by law as well as custom and having a distinctive permanence in ordering social behaviors. Primary or meta-institutions are institutions such as the family that are broad enough to encompass other institutions. Institutions are a principal object of study in social sciences such as political science, anthropology, economics, and sociology (the latter described by Émile Durkheim as the 'science of institutions, their genesis and their functioning'). Institutions are also a central concern for law, the formal mechanism for political rule-making and enforcement and a topic for historians. There are a variety of definitions of institutions. These definitions entail varying levels of formality and organizational complexity. The most expansive definitions may include informal but regularized practices, such as handshakes, whereas the most narrow definitions may only include institutions that are highly formalized (e.g. have specified laws, rules and complex organizational structures). According to Wolfgang Streeck -"
