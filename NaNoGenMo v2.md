"What's North?" a boy queried gently.

The instructor acknowledged the question with a smirk.

The professor said sadly, "Birth -"

The professor paused, expecting a question from the pupils about Mammal or some other topic.

The schoolteacher continued.

The professor said furiously, "- is the act or process of bearing or bringing forth offspring, also referred to in technical contexts as parturition. In mammals, the process is initiated by hormones which cause the muscular walls of the uterus to contract, expelling the fetus at a developmental stage when it is ready to feed and breathe. In some species the offspring is precocial and can move around almost immediately after birth but in others it is altricial and completely dependent on parenting. In marsupials, the fetus is born at a very immature stage after a short gestational period and develops further in its mother's womb's pouch. It is not only mammals that give birth. Some reptiles, amphibians, fish and invertebrates carry their developing young inside them. Some of these are ovoviviparous, with the eggs being hatched inside the mother's body, and others are viviparous, with the embryo developing inside her body, as in the case of mammals. Large mammals, such as primates, cattle, horses, some antelopes, giraffes, hippopotamuses, rhinoceroses, elephants, seals, whales, dolphins, and porpoises, generally are pregnant with one offspring at a time, although they may have twin or multiple births on occasion. In these large animals, the birth process is similar to that of a human, though in most the offspring is precocial. This means that it is born in a more advanced state than a human baby and is able to stand, walk and run (or swim in the case of an aquatic mammal) shortly after birth.In the case of whales, dolphins and porpoises, the single calf is normally born tail first which minimizes the risk of drowning. The mother encourages the newborn calf to rise to the surface of the water to breathe.Most smaller mammals have multiple births, producing litters of young which may number twelve or more. In these animals, each fetus is surrounded by its own amniotic sac and has a separate placenta. This separates from the wall of the uterus during labor and the fetus works its way towards the birth canal.Large mammals which give birth to twins is much more rare, but it does occur occasionally even for mammals as large as elephants. In April 2018, approximately 8-month old elephant twins were sighted joining their mother's herd in the Tarangire National Park of Tanzania, estimated to have been born in August 2017. Humans usually produce a single offspring at a time. The mother's body is prepared for birth by hormones produced by the pituitary gland, the ovary and the placenta. The total gestation period from fertilization to birth is normally about 38 weeks (birth usually occurring 40 weeks after the last menstrual period). The normal process of childbirth takes several hours and has three stages. The first stage starts with a series of involuntary contractions of the muscular walls of the uterus and gradual dilation of the cervix. The active phase of the first stage starts when the cervix is dilated more than about 4 cm in diameter and is when the contractions become stronger and regular. The head (or the buttocks in a breech birth) of the baby is pushed against the cervix, which gradually dilates until is fully dilated at 10 cm diameter. At some time, the amniotic sac bursts and the amniotic fluid escapes (also known as rupture of membranes or breaking the water). In stage two, starting when the cervix is fully dilated, strong contractions of the uterus and active pushing by the mother expels the baby out through the vagina, which during this stage of labour is called a birth canal as this passage contains a baby, and the baby is born with umbilical cord attached. In stage three, which begins after the birth of the baby, further contractions expel the placenta, amniotic sac, and the remaining portion of the umbilical cord usually within a few minutes.Enormous changes take place in the newborn's circulation to enable breathing in air. In the uterus, the unborn baby is dependent on circulation of blood through the placenta for sustenance including gaseous exchange and the unborn baby's blood bypasses the lungs by flowing through the foramen ovale, which is a hole in the septum dividing the right atrium and left atrium. After birth the umbilical cord is clamped and cut, the baby starts to breathe air, and blood from the right ventricle starts to flow to the lungs for gaseous exchange and oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium, which is pumped into the left ventricle, and then pumped into the main arterial system. As a result of these changes, the blood pressure in the left atrium exceeds the pressure in the right atrium, and this pressure difference forces the foramen ovale to close separating the left and right sides of the heart. The umbilical vein, umbilical arteries, ductus venosus and ductus arteriosus are not needed for life in air and in time these vessels become ligaments (embryonic remnants). Birthing in cattle is typical of a larger mammal. A cow goes through three stages of labor during normal delivery of a calf. During stage one, the animal seeks a quiet place away from the rest of the herd. Hormone -"

The educator acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The educator sang quietly, "Coca-Cola -"

"What's Cola?" a student wondered.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the query with a nod.

The professor announced quickly, "Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock, formed as rock strata called coal seams. Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements, chiefly hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. Coal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years. Vast deposits of coal originate in former wetlands—called coal forests—that covered much of the Earth's tropical land areas during the late Carbon -"

The schoolteacher halted, anticipating a query from the pupils about Pangaea or some other topic.

The pupils listened in rapt attention.

The teacher proceeded.

The professor noted quickly, "- (the most recent supercontinent), which then separated into the current continental landmasses. Its name derives from the Ancient Greek words φανερός (phanerós), meaning visible, and ζωή (zōḗ), meaning life; since it was once believed that life began in the Cambrian, the first period of this eon. The term 'Phanerozoic' was coined in 1930 by the American geologist George Halcott Chadwick (1876–1953). The Proterozoic-Phanerozoic boundary is at 541 million years ago. In the 19th century, the boundary was set at time of appearance of the first abundant animal (metazoan) fossils but several hundred groups (taxa) of metazoa of the earlier Proterozoic eon have been identified since the systematic study of those forms started in the 1950s. The Phanerozoic is divided into three eras: the Paleozoic -"

The schoolteacher proceeded.

The educator muttered quickly, "- Ocean is the second-largest of the world's oceans, with an area of about 106,460,000 km2 (41,100,000 sq mi). It covers approximately 20 percent of Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It is known to separate the 'Old World -"

"What's Old World?" a pupil quizzed carefully.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a nervous laugh.

The schoolteacher muttered patiently, "The Old World -"

"What's World?" a girl raised furiously.

The professor acknowledged the question with a smile.

The schoolteacher said slowly, "In its most general sense, the term 'world' refers to the totality of entities, to the whole of reality or to everything that is. The nature of the world has been conceptualized differently in different fields. Some conceptions see the world as unique while others talk of a 'plurality of worlds'. Some treat the world as one simple object while others analyze the world as a complex made up of many parts. In scientific cosmology the world or universe is commonly defined as '[t]he totality of all space and time; all that is, has been, and will be'. Theories of modality, on the other hand, talk of possible worlds as complete and consistent ways how things could have been. Phenomenology, starting from the horizon of co-given objects present in the periphery of every experience, defines the world as the biggest horizon or the 'horizon of all horizons'. In philosophy of mind, the world is commonly contrasted with the mind as that which is represented by the mind. Theology conceptualizes the world in relation to God, for example, as God's creation, as identical to God or as the two being interdependent. In religions, there is often a tendency to downgrade the material or sensory world in favor of a spiritual world to be sought through religious practice. A comprehensive representation of the world and our place in it, as is commonly found in religions, is known as a worldview. Cosmogony -"

"What's Cosmogony?" a pupil quizzed furiously.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The instructor muttered quickly, "Cosmology (from Greek κόσμος, kosmos 'world' and -λογία, -logia 'study of') is a branch of astronomy concerned with the study of the chronology of the universe. Physical cosmology -"

"What's Physical cosmology?" a student blurted breathlessly.

The teacher disregarded the interruption and carried on.

The lecturer announced calmly, "- is the study of the universe's origin, its large-scale structures and dynamics, and the ultimate fate of the universe, including the laws of science that govern these areas.The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation myths and eschatology. Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that cannot be tested. Cosmology differs from astronomy in that the former is concerned with the Universe -"

The lecturer stopped, expecting a question from the pupils about Universe or some other topic.

The students sniggered.

The instructor proceeded.

"Well then, returning to World....", the lecturer announced carefully.

# Lesson 12: Helianthus floridanus

"Good afternoon, class! Today we'll be learning about Helianthus floridanus," the educator elaborated pointedly.

The students stifled their yawns.

The teacher seethed pointedly, "Helianthus -"

"What's Helianthus?" a student questioned mechanically.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The educator declared breathlessly, "Helianthus () is a genus comprising about 70 species of annual and perennial flowering plants in the daisy family Asteraceae. Except for three South America -"

The teacher paused, anticipating a question from the students about South America or some other topic.

The class sat straighter in their seats.

The professor proceeded.

The professor breathed gingerly, "-n species, the species of Helianthus are native to North America -"

The professor halted, listening for a query from the pupils about North America or some other topic.

The pupils suppressed giggles.

The schoolteacher proceeded.

The schoolteacher explained slowly, "- and Central America. The common names 'sunflower' and 'common sunflower' typically refer to the popular annual species Helianthus annuus -"

"What's Helianthus annuus?" a student asked sullenly.

The professor acknowledged the question with a nervous laugh.

The professor noted slowly, "Helianthus annuus, the common sunflower, is a large annual forb of the genus Helianthus grown as a crop for its edible oil and edible fruits. This sunflower species is also used as wild bird food, as livestock forage (as a meal or a silage plant), in some industrial applications, and as an ornamental in domestic gardens. The plant was first domesticated in the Americas. Wild Helianthus annuus is a widely branched annual plant with many flower heads. The domestic sunflower, however, often possesses only a single large inflorescence (flower head) atop an unbranched stem. The name sunflower may derive from the flower's head's shape, which resembles the sun. Sunflower seeds were brought to Europe from the Americas in the 16th century, where, along with sunflower oil, they became a widespread cooking ingredient. The plant has an erect rough-hairy stem, reaching typical heights of 3 metres (9.8 ft). The tallest sunflower on record achieved 9.17 metres (30.1 ft). Sunflower leaves are broad, coarsely toothed, rough and mostly alternate. What is often called the 'flower' of the sunflower is actually a 'flower head' or pseudanthium of numerous small individual five-petaled flowers ('florets'). The outer flowers, which resemble petals, are called ray flowers. Each 'petal' consists of a ligule composed of fused petals of an asymmetrical ray flower. They are sexually sterile and may be yellow, red, orange, or other colors. The flowers in the center of the head are called disk flowers. These mature into fruit (sunflower 'seeds'). The disk flowers are arranged spirally. Generally, each floret is oriented toward the next by approximately the golden angle, 137.5°, producing a pattern of interconnecting spirals, where the number of left spirals and the number of right spirals are successive Fibonacci number -"

"What's Fibonacci number?" a pupil quizzed happily.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The professor noted timidly, "In mathematics, the Fibonacci -"

The professor took a breath, waiting for a question from the class about Fibonacci or some other topic.

The class sniggered.

The instructor continued.

The instructor muttered crudely, "- numbers, commonly denoted Fn, form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is, and for n > 1. The sequence starts: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ... Under some older definitions, the value F 0 = 0 {\displaystyle F_{0}=0} is omitted, so that the sequence starts with F 1 = F 2 = 1 , {\displaystyle F_{1}=F_{2}=1,} and the recurrence F n = F n − 1 + F n − 2 {\displaystyle F_{n}=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}} is valid for n > 2. In his original definition, Fibonacci started the sequence with F 1 = 1 , F 2 = 2 {\displaystyle F_{1}=1,F_{2}=2} Fibonacci numbers are strongly related to the golden ratio: Binet's formula expresses the nth Fibonacci number in terms of n and the golden ratio, and implies that the ratio of two consecutive Fibonacci numbers tends to the golden ratio as n increases. Fibonacci numbers are named after the Italian mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, later known as Fibonacci. In his 1202 book Liber Abaci, Fibonacci introduced the sequence to Western European mathematics, although the sequence had been described earlier in Indian mathematics -"

"What's Indian mathematics?" a boy said.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a grin.

The educator seethed furiously, "India -"

"What's India?" a girl interjected mechanically.

The professor ignored the interruption and proceeded.

The schoolteacher announced, "-n mathematics emerged in the Indian subcontinent from 120 -"

"What's 0?" a student said aggressively.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a nod.

The educator elaborated sadly, "0 (zero) is a number, and the numerical digit used to represent that number in numerals. It fulfills a central role in mathematics as the additive identity of the integers, real numbers, and many other algebraic structures. As a digit, 0 is used as a placeholder in place value systems. Names for the number 0 in English -"

"What's Names for the number 0 in English?" a student questioned excitedly.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The teacher sang quietly, "'Zero' is the usual name for the number 0 in English. In British English 'nought' is also used. In American English -"

"What's American English?" a girl blurted happily.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a smirk.

The schoolteacher said slowly, "American English (AmE, AE, AmEng, USEng, en-US), sometimes called United States -"

The schoolteacher looked around, expecting a question from the pupils about United States or some other topic.

The pupils listened in rapt attention.

The lecturer proceeded.

The professor noted furiously, "- English or U.S. English -"

"What's U.S. English?" a boy wondered aggressively.

The teacher paid no heed to the interruption and carried on.

The schoolteacher murmured, "-, is the set of varieties of the English language -"

"What's English language?" a student asked crudely.

The professor ignored the interruption and proceeded.

The teacher announced furiously, "- native to the United States. English is the most widely spoken language in the United States and in most circumstances is the de facto common language used in government, education, and commerce. Currently, American English is the most influential form of English worldwide.American English varieties include many patterns of pronunciation, vocabulary, grammar, and particularly spelling that are unified nationwide but distinct from other English dialects around the world. Any American or Canadian accent perceived as free of noticeably local, ethnic, or cultural markers is popularly called 'General' or 'Standard' American, a fairly uniform accent continuum native to certain regions of the U.S. and associated nationally with broadcast mass media and highly educated speech. However, historical and present linguistic evidence does not support the notion of there being one single 'mainstream' American accent. The sound of American English continues to evolve, with some local accents disappearing, but several larger regional accents having emerged in the 20th century. The use of English in the United States is a result of British colonization of the Americas -"

"What's British colonization of the Americas?" a girl wondered aggressively.

The educator acknowledged the question with a grin.

The teacher seethed quietly, "The British colonization of the Americas -"

The professor looked around, expecting a question from the students about Americas or some other topic.

The students sat straighter in their seats.

The teacher carried on.

The schoolteacher muttered breathlessly, "- was the history of establishment of control, settlement, and colonization of the continents of the Americas by England -"

The lecturer stopped, expecting a question from the students about England or some other topic.

The pupils stifled their yawns.

The professor continued.

The instructor elaborated furiously, "-, Scotland and Great Britain (after 1707). Colonization efforts began in the 17th century with failed attempts by England to establish permanent colonies in the North. The first permanent British colony was established in Jamestown, Virginia -"

"What's Jamestown, Virginia?" a girl wondered quietly.

The professor paid no attention to the interruption and proceeded.

The lecturer breathed calmly, "- (ouest in French, oest in Catalan, ovest in Italian, oeste in Spanish and Portuguese). As in other languages, the word formation stems from the fact that west is the direction of the setting sun in the evening: 'west' derives from the Indo-European root *wes reduced from *wes-pero 'evening, night', cognate with Ancient Greek ἕσπερος hesperos 'evening; evening star; western' and Latin vesper 'evening; west'. Examples of the same formation in other languages include Latin occidens 'west' from occidō 'to go down, to set' and Hebrew מַעֲרָב maarav 'west' from עֶרֶב erev 'evening'. To go west using a compass for navigation (in a place where magnetic north is the same direction as true north) one needs to set a bearing or azimuth of 270°. West is the direction opposite that of the Earth's rotation on its axis, and is therefore the general direction towards which the Sun -"

Moving continuously west is following a circle of latitude. Due to the direction of the Earth's rotation, the prevailing wind in many places in the middle latitudes (i.e. between 35 and 65 degrees latitude) is from the west, known as the westerlies. The phrase 'the West' is often spoken in reference to the Western world, which includes the European Union -"

The schoolteacher stopped, anticipating a question from the students about European Union or some other topic.

The lecturer sang robotically, "Birth -"

The teacher paused, expecting a query from the class about Mammal or some other topic.

The students stifled their yawns.

The professor proceeded.

The professor sang carefully, "- is the act or process of bearing or bringing forth offspring, also referred to in technical contexts as parturition. In mammals, the process is initiated by hormones which cause the muscular walls of the uterus to contract, expelling the fetus at a developmental stage when it is ready to feed and breathe. In some species the offspring is precocial and can move around almost immediately after birth but in others it is altricial and completely dependent on parenting. In marsupials, the fetus is born at a very immature stage after a short gestational period and develops further in its mother's womb's pouch. It is not only mammals that give birth. Some reptiles, amphibians, fish and invertebrates carry their developing young inside them. Some of these are ovoviviparous, with the eggs being hatched inside the mother's body, and others are viviparous, with the embryo developing inside her body, as in the case of mammals. Large mammals, such as primates, cattle, horses, some antelopes, giraffes, hippopotamuses, rhinoceroses, elephants, seals, whales, dolphins, and porpoises, generally are pregnant with one offspring at a time, although they may have twin or multiple births on occasion. In these large animals, the birth process is similar to that of a human, though in most the offspring is precocial. This means that it is born in a more advanced state than a human baby and is able to stand, walk and run (or swim in the case of an aquatic mammal) shortly after birth.In the case of whales, dolphins and porpoises, the single calf is normally born tail first which minimizes the risk of drowning. The mother encourages the newborn calf to rise to the surface of the water to breathe.Most smaller mammals have multiple births, producing litters of young which may number twelve or more. In these animals, each fetus is surrounded by its own amniotic sac and has a separate placenta. This separates from the wall of the uterus during labor and the fetus works its way towards the birth canal.Large mammals which give birth to twins is much more rare, but it does occur occasionally even for mammals as large as elephants. In April 2018, approximately 8-month old elephant twins were sighted joining their mother's herd in the Tarangire National Park of Tanzania, estimated to have been born in August 2017. Humans usually produce a single offspring at a time. The mother's body is prepared for birth by hormones produced by the pituitary gland, the ovary and the placenta. The total gestation period from fertilization to birth is normally about 38 weeks (birth usually occurring 40 weeks after the last menstrual period). The normal process of childbirth takes several hours and has three stages. The first stage starts with a series of involuntary contractions of the muscular walls of the uterus and gradual dilation of the cervix. The active phase of the first stage starts when the cervix is dilated more than about 4 cm in diameter and is when the contractions become stronger and regular. The head (or the buttocks in a breech birth) of the baby is pushed against the cervix, which gradually dilates until is fully dilated at 10 cm diameter. At some time, the amniotic sac bursts and the amniotic fluid escapes (also known as rupture of membranes or breaking the water). In stage two, starting when the cervix is fully dilated, strong contractions of the uterus and active pushing by the mother expels the baby out through the vagina, which during this stage of labour is called a birth canal as this passage contains a baby, and the baby is born with umbilical cord attached. In stage three, which begins after the birth of the baby, further contractions expel the placenta, amniotic sac, and the remaining portion of the umbilical cord usually within a few minutes.Enormous changes take place in the newborn's circulation to enable breathing in air. In the uterus, the unborn baby is dependent on circulation of blood through the placenta for sustenance including gaseous exchange and the unborn baby's blood bypasses the lungs by flowing through the foramen ovale, which is a hole in the septum dividing the right atrium and left atrium. After birth the umbilical cord is clamped and cut, the baby starts to breathe air, and blood from the right ventricle starts to flow to the lungs for gaseous exchange and oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium, which is pumped into the left ventricle, and then pumped into the main arterial system. As a result of these changes, the blood pressure in the left atrium exceeds the pressure in the right atrium, and this pressure difference forces the foramen ovale to close separating the left and right sides of the heart. The umbilical vein, umbilical arteries, ductus venosus and ductus arteriosus are not needed for life in air and in time these vessels become ligaments (embryonic remnants). Birthing in cattle is typical of a larger mammal. A cow goes through three stages of labor during normal delivery of a calf. During stage one, the animal seeks a quiet place away from the rest of the herd. Hormone -"

Due to the hereditary principle of the Fujiwara Regents, Michinaga was now in line to become Regent after his brothers, Michitaka and Michikane. Michitaka was regent from 990 until 995, when he died. Michikane then succeeded him, famously ruling as Regent for only seven days, before he too died of disease. With his two elder brothers dead, Michinaga then struggled with Fujiwara no Korechika, Michitaka's eldest son and the successor he had named.

"Well then, turning back our attention to Eurasia....", the lecturer breathed slowly.

The students sat straighter in their seats.

"Well then, turning back our attention to Europe....", the lecturer seethed quietly.

The pupils watched quietly.

"Now then, returning to World War I....", the lecturer breathed breathlessly.

The pupils suppressed giggles.

"Now, getting back to World War I....", the schoolteacher seethed calmly.

The class listened in rapt attention.

"Alright, going back to Empire of Japan....", the schoolteacher declared pointedly.

The students watched quietly.

"Alright, going back to Emperor Meiji....", the educator explained slowly.

The pupils stifled their yawns.

"Now, returning to Meiji (era)....", the professor declared politely.

The class suppressed giggles.

"Now then, getting back to Naidaijin....", the educator muttered.

The students stifled their yawns.

"Alright, back again to Fujiwara no Michinaga....", the professor seethed.

The pupils stifled their yawns.

"Well then, returning to Reizei family....", the teacher said sullenly.

The pupils watched quietly.

The bell blared.

"That's all the time we have. I hope you learned something today," the schoolteacher declared carefully.

The class vacated the room robotically.

# Lesson 24: Terminal Freeze

"Greetings, class! Today we'll be discussing Terminal Freeze," the professor elaborated patiently.

The pupils listened in rapt attention.

The lecturer announced calmly, "Terminal Freeze is the fourth solo novel by Lincoln Child. The novel was released on February 24, 2009 by Random House -"

The lecturer paused, anticipating a question from the class about Random House or some other topic.

The educator continued.

The educator sang breathlessly, "-. It is the second novel in the Jeremy Logan series. The events take place in Alaska, north of the Arctic Circle. A decommissioned military base located near the fictional Mount Fear, the Mount Fear Remote Sensing Installation, is being used by a research team from Northern Massachusetts University to study the effects of global warming on a receding glacier. The team consists of five scientists from the University - Evan Marshall, a paleoecologist; Gerard Sully, a climatologist and the team leader; Wright Faraday, an evolutionary biologist; Ang Chen, a graduate student; and Penny Barbour, a computer scientist - along with the skeleton crew of four soldiers - Corporal Marcelin, Privates First Class Tad Phillips and Donovan Fluke, and the leader, Sergeant Paul Gonzalez. The expedition discovers a monstrous ancient animal, presumed to be a preserved example of Smilodon -"

"What's Smilodon?" a pupil raised calmly.

The professor acknowledged the query with a smile.

The educator paid no attention to the interruption and carried on.

The teacher declared pointedly, "- populator, frozen in solid ice inside a lava tube made into an ice cave. The expedition's corporate sponsors, Terra Prime and its parent corporation Blackpool Entertainment, sense huge publicity and decide to have the beast cut from the ice, thawed, and revealed live on television. A massive entourage is sent to the base to begin production of the documentary, and the new crew includes Kari Ekberg, the field producer; Emilio Conti, the eccentric director (along with his assistant Hulce); Allan Fortnum, the director of photography; Ken Toussaint, the assistant director of photography; Wolff, the network liaison and channel representative; George Creel, the production foreman; and Ashleigh Davis, the spoiled host and star of the show (along with her assistant Brianna). The group is later joined by the truck driver Carradine, who brings Davis' luxurious trailer to the site, and a man who hitched a ride with Carradine, named Dr. Jeremy Logan, a private investigator and Yale professor of medieval history. Meanwhile, local Tunit people, led by their chief Usuguk, try to warn the scientists that they do not understand what they have found. Specific warnings are that the entire mountain it was found in is a place of evil, the creature exists only for the sole purpose of killing, and that the Tunit do not believe it is dead. In addition, after a reexamination of the creature by Marshall, Faraday, and Barbour, it is revealed that the creature is not a Smilodon at all, but a new, unknown animal entirely, which may be up to 16 feet in length. However, Conti and Wolff are determined to move forward with the production, up until the creature suddenly vanishes from the vault it is being stored in. Although they initially believe it to be stolen, analysis of the hole in the vault floor by Faraday reveals that the incisions in the wood were made from the inside, and appear to be made by something more natural than a tool. Meanwhile, Logan reveals to Marshall that he is investigating the base itself after uncovering recently declassified government documents, detailing an incident at the base in 1958 that resulted in the deaths of 7 of the 8 scientists there. The incident, however, was forgotten when the officer reporting it, Colonel H.N. Rose, died in a plane crash with the full, detailed report. When a production assistant named Josh Peters, Davis, and Fluke are all suddenly and brutally killed, along with Toussaint and Brianna being wounded, Gonzalez decides that the base has to be evacuated immediately. Carradine offers to transport everyone in his semi's trailer, and although Wolff initially objects, Gonzalez overrides him and agrees. Everyone boards the trailer and flees, leaving behind only the three remaining soldiers, Marshall, Logan, Ekberg, Sully, Conti, Wolff, Faraday, and Creel. After Logan investigates the abandoned quarters of the base's previous science team, he discovers a small journal left behind and hidden in a crawlspace by one of the former occupants, which, among other things, says that the Tunit have the answer to whatever it was that killed the team. Marshall decides to take the Sno-Cat and travel to the Tunit village, only to find that all of the Tunit have fled for the shoreline, leaving behind only the elderly shaman Usuguk. After Marshall's pleas for help and information about the monster, Usuguk reveals that he was the sole survivor of the crew of '58, and agrees to go back to the base with Marshall. Once they return, Usuguk explains the full story, and how the crew of the base discovered a similar creature similarly encased in ice, cut it out, and brought it back to the base. Usuguk calls it the kurrshuq (the 'Fang of the Gods' and the 'Devourer of Souls'), a local legend among the Tunit people for generations, and shocks everyone by explaining that the creature, upon thawing out and coming alive, was actually quiet friendly and playful. However, only after one scientist attempted to study its hunting habits by playing recordings of animal screams, did the creature suddenly turn violent and kill all except Usuguk. He then reveals one final, chilling detail: The kurrshuq that killed the team in 1958, before it also suddenly died and its body vanished, was no bigger than an Arctic fox -"

"What's Arctic fox?" a pupil said crudely.

The educator acknowledged the query with a grin.

The professor ignored the interruption and continued.

The bell sounded.

"That's all the time we have. I hope you learned something today," the instructor noted carefully.

The class exited the room mechanically.

# Lesson 25: Integrated topside design

"Good morning, class! Today we'll be talking about Integrated topside design," the lecturer sang calmly.

The students sniggered.

The teacher said gingerly, "Integrated topside design is a design approach used by military ship and ship equipment designers to overcome the challenges of effectively operating shipboard antenna systems and equipment susceptible to electromagnetic fields in the high electromagnetic environment of a warship's topside. The approach primarily uses the well-understood physics of electromagnetism to simulate the topside environment before the equipment is tested for real. Advances in ship design to accommodate ever more high power antenna systems, numbers of parasitic re-radiating metallic structures (such as cranes and masts) and a requirement to have more sensitive sensors for littoral operations has led to a need for greater consideration of the operation of equipment prior to ship build or prior to equipment deployment. Whilst this can be done post-deployment using measurement teams, using a modelling and simulation approach early in the ship design is more cost-effective than making corrections after the ship is built, and so is the preferred option for several of the world's advanced navies. Lubben, J, 'MilCis Integrated Top Side Design -"

"What's Design?" a student asked happily.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The lecturer seethed happily, "A design is a plan or specification for the construction of an object or system or for the implementation of an activity or process, or the result of that plan or specification in the form of a prototype, product or process. The verb to design expresses the process of developing a design. In some cases, the direct construction of an object without an explicit prior plan (such as in craftwork, some engineering, coding, and graphic design) may also be considered to be a design activity. The design usually has to satisfy certain goals and constraints, may take into account aesthetic, functional, economic, or socio-political considerations, and is expected to interact with a certain environment. Major examples of designs include architectural blueprints, engineering drawings, business processes, circuit diagrams, and sewing patterns.The person who produces a design is called a designer, which is a term generally used for people who work professionally in one of the various design areas—usually specifying which area is being dealt with (such as a fashion designer, product designer, web designer or interior designer), but also others such as architects and engineers. A designer's sequence of activities is called a design process, possibly using design methods. The process of creating a design can be brief (a quick sketch) or lengthy and complicated, involving considerable research, negotiation, reflection, modeling, interactive adjustment and re-design. Substantial disagreement exists concerning how designers in many fields, whether amateur or professional, alone or in teams, produce designs. Kees Dorst and Judith Dijkhuis, both designers themselves, argued that 'there are many ways of describing design processes' and discussed 'two basic and fundamentally different ways', both of which have several names. The prevailing view has been called 'the rational model', 'technical problem solving' and 'the reason-centric perspective'. The alternative view has been called 'reflection-in-action', 'co-evolution', and 'the action-centric perspective'. The rational model was independently developed by Herbert A. Simon, an American scientist, and two German engineering design theorists, Gerhard Pahl and Wolfgang Beitz. It posits that: Designer -"

"What's Designer?" a student asked carefully.

The instructor acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The educator ignored the interruption and continued.

The educator declared patiently, "-s attempt to optimize a design candidate for known constraints and objectives. The design process is plan-driven. The design process is understood in terms of a discrete sequence of stages.The rational model is based on a rationalist philosophy and underlies the waterfall model, systems development life cycle, and much of the engineering design literature. According to the rationalist philosophy, design is informed by research and knowledge in a predictable and controlled manner. = = Typical stages consistent with the rational model include the following: Pre-production design Design brief or Parti pris – an early (often the beginning) statement of design goals Analysis – analysis of current design goals Research – investigating similar design solutions in the field or related topics Specification -"

"What's Specification?" a pupil asked calmly.

The instructor acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The instructor seethed sadly, "A specification often refers to a set of documented requirements to be satisfied by a material, design, product, or service. A specification is often a type of technical standard. There are different types of technical or engineering specifications (specs), and the term is used differently in different technical contexts. They often refer to particular documents, and/or particular information within them. The word specification is broadly defined as 'to state explicitly or in detail' or 'to be specific'. A requirement specification is a documented requirement, or set of documented requirements, to be satisfied by a given material, design, product, service, etc. It is a common early part of engineering design and product development processes in many fields. A functional specification is a kind of requirement specification, and may show functional block diagrams.A design or product specification describes the features of the solutions for the Requirement -"

"What's Requirement?" a boy raised excitedly.

The educator disregarded the interruption and proceeded.

The instructor declared sullenly, "- Specification -"

"What's Specification?" a girl interjected carefully.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the query with a smile.

The schoolteacher elaborated sullenly, "A specification often refers to a set of documented requirements to be satisfied by a material, design, product, or service.

The teacher took a breath, expecting a question from the students about Requirement or some other topic.

The class sat straighter in their seats.

The professor carried on.

The educator muttered aggressively, "- Specification -"

"What's Specification?" a boy asked quickly.

The educator acknowledged the query with a nervous laugh.

The teacher murmured calmly, "A specification often refers to a set of documented requirements to be satisfied by a material, design, product, or service.

A functional specification is a kind of requirement specification, and may show functional block diagrams.A design or product specification describes the features of the solutions for the Requirement -"

"What's Requirement?" a girl piped up gingerly.

The professor acknowledged the query with a smile.

The schoolteacher explained politely, "In product development and process optimization, a requirement is a singular documented physical or functional need that a particular design, product or process aims to satisfy. It is commonly used in a formal sense in engineering design, including for example in systems engineering, software engineering, or enterprise engineering. It is a broad concept that could speak to any necessary (or sometimes desired) function, attribute, capability, characteristic, or quality of a system for it to have value and utility to a customer, organization, internal user, or other stakeholder. Requirements can come with different levels of specificity; for example, a requirement specification or requirement 'spec' (often imprecisely referred to as 'the' spec/specs, but there are actually different sorts of specifications) refers to an explicit, highly objective/clear (and often quantitative) requirement (or sometimes, set of requirements) to be satisfied by a material, design, product, or service.A set of requirements is used as inputs into the design stages of product development. Requirements are also an important input into the verification process, since tests should trace back to specific requirements. Requirements show what elements and functions are necessary for the particular project. When iterative methods of software development or agile methods are used, the system requirements are incrementally developed in parallel with design and implementation. With the waterfall model requirements are developed before design and implementation. The term requirement has been in use in the software engineering community since at least the 1960s.According to the Guide to the Business Analysis Body of Knowledge® version 2 from IIBA (BABOK), a requirement is: A condition or capability needed by a stakeholder to solve a problem or achieve an objective. A condition or capability that must be met or possessed by a solution or solution component to satisfy a contract, standard, specification, or other formally imposed documents. A documented representation of a condition or capability as in (1) or (2).This definition is based on IEEE 610.12-1990: IEEE Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology. Requirements can be said to relate to two fields: Product requirements prescribe properties of a system or product. Process requirements prescribe activities to be performed by the developing organization. For instance, process requirements could specify the methodologies that must be followed, and constraints that the organization must obey.Product and process requirements are closely linked; a product requirement could be said to specify the automation required to support a process requirement while a process requirement could be said to specify the activities required to support a product requirement. For example, a maximum development cost requirement (a process requirement) may be imposed to help achieve a maximum sales price requirement (a product requirement); a requirement that the product be maintainable (a product requirement) often is addressed by imposing requirements to follow particular development styles (e.g., object-oriented programming), style-guides, or a review/inspection process (process requirements). Requirements are typically classified into types produced at different stages in a development progression, with the taxonomy depending on the overall model being used. For example, the following scheme was devised by the International Institute of Business Analysis -"

The professor paused, expecting a question from the students about International Institute of Business Analysis or some other topic.

The schoolteacher proceeded.

"Well then, returning to Specification (technical standard)....", the educator declared mechanically.

The pupils watched quietly.

"Now then, getting back to Specification (technical standard)....", the professor announced gently.

The students sat straighter in their seats.

"So, getting back to Specification (technical standard)....", the professor elaborated happily.

The students sat straighter in their seats.

"Now then, back again to Design....", the schoolteacher explained gingerly.

The class suppressed giggles.

"Okay, returning to Integrated topside design....", the educator sang pointedly.

The students sniggered.

The bell rang.

"That's all the time we have. I hope you learned something today," the teacher murmured confidently.

The pupils crowded out of the room aggressively.

# Lesson 26: Pampas

"Hello and welcome, class! Today we'll be discussing Pampas," the instructor said sadly.

The students sniggered.

The teacher murmured quickly, "The Pampas (from the Quechua: pampa, meaning 'plain') are fertile South America -"

The teacher paused, listening for a question from the students about South America or some other topic.

The students sniggered.

The teacher carried on.

The schoolteacher explained gingerly, "-n lowlands that cover more than 1,200,000 square kilometres (460,000 sq mi) and include the Argentine provinces of Buenos Aires, La Pampa, Santa Fe, Entre Ríos, and Córdoba; all of Uruguay -"

"What's Uruguay?" a student raised aggressively.

The teacher ignored the interruption and continued.

The instructor muttered slowly, "-; and Brazil -"

The lecturer looked around, listening for a query from the class about Brazil or some other topic.

The class sat straighter in their seats.

The professor continued.

The lecturer said gingerly, "-'s southernmost state, Rio Grande do Sul -"

"What's Rio Grande do Sul?" a student queried quietly.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The educator muttered carefully, "Rio Grande do Sul (UK: , US: , Portuguese: [ˈʁi.u ˈɡɾɐ̃dʒ(i) du ˈsuw] (listen); lit. 'Great River of the South') is a state in the southern region of Brazil -"

The instructor paused, listening for a query from the pupils about Brazil or some other topic.

The class watched quietly.

The educator carried on.

The educator murmured aggressively, "-. It is the fifth-most-populous state and the ninth largest by area. Located in the southernmost part of the country, Rio Grande do Sul is bordered clockwise by Santa Catarina to the north and northeast, the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the Uruguay -"

"What's Uruguay?" a boy wondered patiently.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The instructor sang breathlessly, "Uruguay ( (listen); Spanish: [uɾuˈɣwaj] (listen); Portuguese: Uruguai), officially the Oriental Republic of Uruguay, is a country in South America. It shares borders with Argentina to its west and southwest and Brazil to its north and northeast; while bordering the Río de la Plata -"

The schoolteacher looked around, anticipating a question from the pupils about Río de la Plata or some other topic.

The class sat straighter in their seats.

The lecturer proceeded.

The schoolteacher noted quickly, "- to the south and the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast. Uruguay covers an area of approximately 176,000 square kilometers (68,000 sq mi) and has a population of an estimated 3.51 million, of whom 2 million live in the metropolitan area of its capital and largest city, Montevideo -"

"What's Montevideo?" a boy blurted mechanically.

The instructor acknowledged the query with a nervous laugh.

The instructor muttered furiously, "Montevideo (Spanish pronunciation: [monteβiˈðeo]) is the capital and largest city of Uruguay -"

"What's Uruguay?" a boy said breathlessly.

The professor ignored the interruption and proceeded.

The lecturer muttered patiently, "-. According to the 2011 census, the city proper has a population of 1,319,108 (about one-third of the country's total population) in an area of 201 square kilometers (78 sq mi). Montevideo is situated on the southern coast of the country, on the northeastern bank of the Río de la Plata -"

"What's Río de la Plata?" a girl demanded mechanically.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a smile.

The lecturer murmured furiously, "The Río de la Plata (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈri.o ðe la ˈplata] (listen), lit. 'river of silver'), called River Plate in British English -"

"What's British English?" a student blurted sadly.

The educator acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The lecturer announced, "British English (BrE) or UK English is the standard dialect of the English language as spoken and written in the United Kingdom -"

"What's United Kingdom?" a boy raised breathlessly.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a smile.

The teacher elaborated, "The United Kingdom of Great Britain -"

"What's Kingdom of Great Britain?" a pupil demanded robotically.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a grin.

The lecturer seethed breathlessly, "The Kingdom of Great Britain -"

"What's Great Britain?" a student queried furiously.

The instructor acknowledged the question with a smirk.

The educator declared carefully, "Great Britain is an island in the North Atlantic Ocean -"

"What's Atlantic Ocean?" a student demanded carefully.

The instructor acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The schoolteacher murmured, "The Atlantic -"

"What's Atlantic?" a student demanded carefully.

The instructor acknowledged the question with a smile.

The professor sang breathlessly, "The Atlantic -"

"What's Atlantic?" a boy said gently.

The professor paid no attention to the interruption and continued.

The lecturer announced calmly, "- Ocean is the second-largest of the world's oceans, with an area of about 106,460,000 km2 (41,100,000 sq mi). It covers approximately 20 percent of Earth -"

"What's Earth?" a boy raised aggressively.

The professor acknowledged the question with a smile.

The instructor paid no heed to the interruption and proceeded.

The lecturer announced robotically, "-'s surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It is known to separate the 'Old World' of Europe -"

"What's Europe?" a pupil asked slowly.

The professor ignored the interruption and continued.

The educator seethed breathlessly, "- and Asia -"

"What's Asia?" a pupil questioned quietly.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a nod.

The professor sang carefully, "Asia ( (listen)) is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the Eastern and Northern Hemisphere -"

The lecturer paused, listening for a query from the pupils about Northern Hemisphere or some other topic.

The students listened in rapt attention.

The schoolteacher carried on.

The professor seethed patiently, "-s. It shares the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe -"

The schoolteacher looked around, anticipating a query from the pupils about Europe or some other topic.

The pupils listened in rapt attention.

The instructor proceeded.

The teacher murmured excitedly, "- and the continental landmass of Afro-Eurasia -"

"What's Afro-Eurasia?" a student queried timidly.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The instructor paid no attention to the interruption and proceeded.

The lecturer noted excitedly, "- with both Europe and Africa -"

"What's Africa?" a student queried aggressively.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the query with a smile.

The educator said politely, "The United States (U.S. or US -"

"What's US?" a pupil wondered patiently.

The instructor disregarded the interruption and carried on.

The lecturer sang breathlessly, "-), officially the United States of America -"

The lecturer explained gently, "An Indian reservation is an area of land tenure governed by a federally recognized Native American tribal nation under the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs -"

The instructor paused, waiting for a question from the students about Bureau of Indian Affairs or some other topic.

The teacher carried on.

The instructor muttered gently, "-, rather than by the government of the state in which it is located. The 326 Indian reservations in the United States -"

The educator halted, expecting a query from the students about United States or some other topic.

The pupils sniggered.

The instructor carried on.

The professor said crudely, "- are associated with specific Native American nations, often on a one-to-one basis. Some of the country's 574 federally recognized tribes govern more than one reservation, while some share reservations, and others have no reservation at all. In addition, because of past land allotments, leading to sales to non–Native Americans, some reservations are severely fragmented, with each piece of tribal, individual, and privately held land being a separate enclave. This jumble of private and public real estate creates significant administrative, political and legal difficulties.The collective geographical area of all reservations is 56,200,000 acres (22,700,000 ha; 87,800 sq mi; 227,000 km2), approximately the size of the state of Idaho. While most reservations are small compared to U.S. state -"

# Lesson 27: Mordellistenoda fukiensis

"Greetings, class! Today we'll be learning about Mordellistenoda fukiensis," the teacher sang gingerly.

The pupils listened in rapt attention.

The schoolteacher sang patiently, "Mordellistenoda -"

"What's Mordellistenoda?" a boy said happily.

The professor ignored the interruption and continued.

The lecturer noted excitedly, "- fukiensis is a beetle in the genus Mordellistenoda of the family Mordellidae -"

"What's Mordellidae?" a pupil piped up calmly.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a nervous laugh.

The professor declared mechanically, "The Mordellidae are a family of beetles commonly known as tumbling flower beetles for the typical irregular movements they make when escaping predators, or as pintail beetles due to their abdominal tip which aids them in performing these tumbling movements. Worldwide, there are about 1500 species. The apparently tumbling movements are composed of a series of very rapid separate jumps (each jump of a duration of approximately 80 ms). They result from the beetle's efforts to get itself back into take-off position for flight when it has been in either lateral or dorsal position. Each individual jump should be considered as an extended rotation, performed by one leg of the third leg pair (metapodium). Depending on whether the left or the right metapodium is used as the leg that provides the leverage for take-off, change occurs in the direction of the jump. The energy for propulsion varies with the beetle's immediate muscle work, so that jump lengths and heights vary, with rotation frequencies recorded up to 48 per second (Mordellochroa abdominalis) around the gravitation centre of the body's longitudinal axis. Additional revolving around the transverse axis (at lower frequency) effects spiralling somersaults that are perceived as tumbling. The pintail (pygidium) is of no significance for the jump. While the pintail is no significance for the jump, meta-trochanter-femur (thighs and surrounding rings of the third leg pair)has a great capacity of free rotation (up to 270 degrees, at one level only). This capacity is due to a screw joint that connects the base of metacoxa to the head of trochanter. The nut gradient is 21 degrees (as seen under a scanning electron microscopy SEM, 1985). Technically similar jumps, though less powerful, can be observed in family Melandryidae -"

"What's Melandryidae?" a boy quizzed excitedly.

The professor ignored the interruption and continued.

The professor sang calmly, "- (=Serropalpidae) (genus Orchesia) and family Scraptiidae -"

"What's Scraptiidae?" a girl wondered politely.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a nod.

The educator explained sadly, "The family Scraptiidae is a small group of beetles sometimes called false flower beetles. There are about 400 species in 30 genera with a world-wide distribution. The adults are found on flowers, sometimes in large numbers. These beetles are very common and easily confused with members of the related family Mordellidae -"

"What's Mordellidae?" a boy wondered slowly.

"What's Melandryidae?" a girl demanded robotically.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The lecturer noted calmly, "Melandryidae is a family of false darkling beetles in the order Coleoptera -"

"What's Coleoptera?" a boy raised carefully.

The instructor acknowledged the question with a grin.

The professor announced crudely, "Beetles are insects that form the order Coleoptera -"

"What's Coleoptera?" a pupil queried calmly.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a nervous laugh.

The professor said aggressively, "Beetles are insects that form the order Coleoptera -"

"What's Coleoptera?" a pupil asked calmly.

The educator disregarded the interruption and carried on.

The schoolteacher breathed gingerly, "- (), in the superorder Endopterygota. Their front pair of wings are hardened into wing-cases, elytra, distinguishing them from most other insects. The Coleoptera, with about 400,000 species, is the largest of all orders, constituting almost 40% of described insects and 25% of all known animal life-forms; new species are discovered frequently. The largest of all families, the Curculionidae (weevils), with some 83,000 member species, belongs to this order. Found in almost every habitat except the sea and the polar regions, they interact with their ecosystems in several ways: beetles often feed on plants and fungi, break down animal and plant debris, and eat other invertebrates. Some species are serious agricultural pests, such as the Colorado potato beetle, while others such as Coccinellidae -"

"What's Coccinellidae?" a boy piped up robotically.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a nod.

The lecturer muttered quietly, "Coccinellidae () is a widespread family of small beetles ranging in size from 0.8 to 18 mm (0.03 to 0.71 in). The family is commonly known as ladybugs in North America and ladybirds in Great Britain and other parts of the English-speaking world. Entomologists prefer the names ladybird beetles or lady beetles as these insects are not classified as true bugs.The majority of coccinellid species are generally considered beneficial insects, because many species prey on herbivorous hemipterans such as aphids or scale insects, which are agricultural pests. Many coccinellids lay their eggs directly in aphid and scale insect colonies in order to ensure their larvae have an immediate food source. However, some species do have unwelcome effects; among these, the most prominent are of the subfamily Epilachninae (which includes the Mexican bean beetle), which are herbivorous themselves. Usually, epilachnines are only minor agricultural pests, eating the leaves of grain, potatoes, beans, and various other crops, but their numbers can increase exponentially in years when their natural enemies, such as parasitoid wasps that attack their eggs, are in fewer numbers. In such situations, they can do major crop damage. They occur in practically all the major crop-producing regions of temperate and tropical countries. The name coccinellids is derived from the Latin word coccineus meaning 'scarlet'. The name 'ladybird' originated in Britain where the insects became known as 'Our Lady's bird' or the Lady beetle. Mary (Our Lady) was often depicted wearing a red cloak in early paintings, and the spots of the seven-spot ladybird (the most common in Europe -"

The professor took a breath, listening for a query from the pupils about Europe or some other topic.

The pupils suppressed giggles.

The schoolteacher carried on.

The professor said sadly, "-) were said to symbolise her seven joys and seven sorrows. In the United States -"

"What's United States?" a boy queried patiently.

The instructor acknowledged the question with a nod.

The schoolteacher seethed politely, "The United States (U.S. or US), officially the United States of America -"

"What's America?" a student queried quickly.

The instructor acknowledged the query with a nod.

The schoolteacher noted quietly, "The United States (U.S. or US), officially the United States of America -"

"What's America?" a pupil interjected gingerly.

The schoolteacher ignored the interruption and continued.

The instructor sang patiently, "- (U.S.A. or USA -"

"What's USA?" a student questioned quickly.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a nervous laugh.

The teacher ignored the interruption and carried on.

The teacher noted sadly, "-) or America, is a country primarily located in North America. It consists of 50 states, a federal district, five major unincorporated territories, 326 Indian reservations, and some minor possessions. At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million square kilometers), it is the world's third- or fourth-largest country by total area. The United States shares significant land borders with Canada to the north and Mexico to the south as well as limited maritime borders with the Bahamas, Cuba, and Russia -"

The teacher halted, expecting a question from the class about Russia or some other topic.

The professor continued.

The lecturer sang calmly, "-. With a population of more than 331 million people, it is the third most populous country in the world. The national capital is Washington, D.C. -"

The schoolteacher paused, expecting a question from the pupils about Washington, D.C. or some other topic.

The professor declared confidently, "-, and the most populous city is New York City -"

The educator looked around, expecting a question from the class about New York City or some other topic.

The students listened in rapt attention.

The professor carried on.

The instructor muttered gingerly, "-. Paleo-Indians -"

"What's Paleo-Indians?" a girl blurted quickly.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The teacher muttered gently, "Paleo-Indians, Paleoindians or Paleo-Americans, were the first peoples who entered, and subsequently inhabited, the Americas -"

"What's Americas?" a boy questioned robotically.

The professor acknowledged the query with a smile.

The educator muttered aggressively, "The Americas, which are also collectively called America, are a landmass comprising the totality of North and South America -"

"What's South America?" a student piped up slowly.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a grin.

The instructor sang patiently, "North America is a continent in the Northern Hemisphere -"

The educator halted, listening for a question from the pupils about Northern Hemisphere or some other topic.

The pupils stifled their yawns.

The educator carried on.

The schoolteacher noted quickly, "- and almost entirely within the Western Hemisphere -"

"What's Western Hemisphere?" a pupil wondered quietly.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a grin.

The educator noted, "The West -"

"What's West?" a boy raised breathlessly.

The educator acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The professor declared quickly, "West or O -"

"What's Navigation?" a girl quizzed calmly.

The schoolteacher ignored the interruption and carried on.

The instructor breathed crudely, "-ccident is one of the four cardinal directions or points of the compass. It is the opposite direction from East and is the direction in which the sun sets. The word 'west' is a Germanic word passed into some Romance languages (ouest in French, oest in Catalan, ovest in Italian, oeste in Spanish and Portuguese). As in other languages, the word formation stems from the fact that west is the direction of the setting sun in the evening: 'west' derives from the Indo-European root *wes reduced from *wes-pero 'evening, night', cognate with Ancient Greek ἕσπερος hesperos 'evening; evening star; western' and Latin vesper 'evening; west'. Examples of the same formation in other languages include Latin occidens 'west' from occidō 'to go down, to set' and Hebrew מַעֲרָב maarav 'west' from עֶרֶב erev 'evening'. To go west using a compass for navigation (in a place where magnetic north is the same direction as true north) one needs to set a bearing or azimuth of 270°. West is the direction opposite that of the Earth -"

"What's Earth?" a boy wondered aggressively.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a grin.

The lecturer paid no heed to the interruption and continued.

"Alright, getting back to Western Hemisphere....", the instructor said politely.

The pupils suppressed giggles.

"Okay, getting back to North America....", the lecturer noted.

The students sat straighter in their seats.

The schoolteacher paused, expecting a query from the students about Antarctica or some other topic.

The class sat straighter in their seats.

The professor continued.

The teacher declared pointedly, "-, it is the site of the United States Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station, which was established in 1956 and has been permanently staffed since that year. The Geographic South Pole is distinct from the South Magnetic Pole -"

The instructor stopped, anticipating a query from the pupils about South Magnetic Pole or some other topic.

The class watched quietly.

The educator continued.

The educator said confidently, "-, the position of which is defined based on Earth's magnetic field. The South Pole is at the centre of the Southern Hemisphere -"

The schoolteacher paused, waiting for a query from the class about Southern Hemisphere or some other topic.

The class watched quietly.

The lecturer proceeded.

The schoolteacher breathed sadly, "-. For most purposes, the Geographic South Pole is defined as the southern point of the two points where Earth's axis of rotation intersects its surface (the other being the Geographic North Pole). However, Earth's axis of rotation is actually subject to very small 'wobbles' (polar motion), so this definition is not adequate for very precise work. The geographic coordinates of the South Pole are usually given simply as 90°S, since its longitude is geometrically undefined and irrelevant. When a longitude is desired, it may be given as 0°. At the South Pole, all directions face north. For this reason, directions at the Pole are given relative to 'grid north', which points northward along the prime meridian. Along tight latitude circles, clockwise is east, and anti-clockwise is west, opposite to the North Pole. The Geographic South Pole is presently located on the continent of Antarctica, although this has not been the case for all of Earth's history because of continental drift. It sits atop a featureless, barren, windswept and icy plateau at an altitude of 2,835 m (9,301 ft) above sea level, and is located about 1,300 km (810 mi) from the nearest open sea at the Bay of Whales -"

The professor continued.

The schoolteacher announced carefully, "-s was a natural ice harbour, or iceport, indenting the front of the Ross Ice Shelf just north of Roosevelt Island, Antarctica -"

"What's Antarctica?" a girl wondered slowly.

The professor disregarded the interruption and carried on.

The teacher muttered mechanically, "-. It is the southernmost point of open ocean not only of the Ross Sea, but worldwide. The Ross Sea extends much further south – as far as the Gould Coast, some 320 kilometres (170 nautical miles) from the South Pole -"

"What's South Pole?" a student piped up breathlessly.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The professor noted confidently, "The South Pole, also known as the Geographic South Pole or Terrestrial South Pole, is one of the two points where Earth's axis of rotation intersects its surface.

Alexis Curvers' mother died when he was three years old and his father when he was nineteen. He followed the courses of Marie Delcourt at the University of Liège. Appointed a professor of rhetoric at Alexandria, he returned to Liege where he married Marie Delcourt. In 1933 he published an article entitled De l'objection de conscience which led him to be excluded from teaching. In 1940, he took refuge in the south of France, where he met other writers at Mme Mayrisch, before he returned to Liège. In 1957, his novel Tempo di Roma -"

The instructor paused, anticipating a query from the students about Tempo di Roma or some other topic.

The students sniggered.

The lecturer proceeded.

The teacher muttered happily, "-, rejected by Éditions Gallimard but published by Éditions Robert Laffont -"

"What's Éditions Robert Laffont?" a student queried quietly.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a nervous laugh.

The educator breathed calmly, "Éditions Robert Laffont is a book publishing company in France -"

Beginning in the 16th century, British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast. As a consequence of various armed conflicts, France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763. In 1867, with the union of three British North America -"

"What's British North America?" a boy questioned pointedly.

The instructor ignored the interruption and continued.

The schoolteacher breathed calmly, "-n colonies through Confederation, Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces. This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom -"

The teacher stopped, listening for a question from the students about United Kingdom or some other topic.

The schoolteacher carried on.

The lecturer announced calmly, "-. This widening autonomy was highlighted by the Statute of Westminster 1931 -"

"What's Statute of Westminster 1931?" a girl piped up slowly.

The professor paid no attention to the interruption and continued.

The professor looked around, waiting for a question from the pupils about Parliament of the United Kingdom or some other topic.

The pupils stifled their yawns.

The instructor proceeded.

The instructor muttered calmly, "- and one of the enactments which make up the Constitution of Canada. It was enacted at the request of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada to patriate Canada's Constitution, ending the power of the British Parliament to amend the Constitution. The Act also formally ended the 'request and consent' provisions of the Statute of Westminster 1931 in relation to Canada, whereby the British parliament had a general power to pass laws extending to Canada at its own request. Annexed as Schedule B to the act is the text of the Constitution Act, 1982, in both of Canada's official languages (i.e. English and French). Because of the requirements of official bilingualism, the body of the Canada Act itself is also set out in French in Schedule A to the act, which is declared by s. 3 to have 'the same authority in Canada as the English version thereof'. Canada's modern political history as a union of previously separate provinces began with the British North America Act, 1867 (officially called the Constitution Act, 1867 in Canada).

"What's Governor General?" a girl piped up breathlessly.

The educator acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The teacher elaborated quietly, "Governor -"

"What's Governor?" a girl quizzed patiently.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The professor announced breathlessly, "A governor is, in most cases, a public official with the power to govern the executive branch of a non-sovereign or sub-national level of government, ranking under the head of state. In federations, governor may be the title of a politician who governs a constituent state and may be either appointed or elected. The power of the individual governor can vary dramatically between political systems, with some governors having only nominal or largely ceremonial power, with others having complete control over the entire government. Historically, the title can also apply to the executive officials acting as representatives of a chartered company which has been granted exercise of sovereignty in a colonial area, such as the British East India Company or the Dutch East India Company. These companies operate as a major state within a state with its own armed forces. There can also be non-political governors: high-ranking officials in private or similar governance such as commercial and non-profit management, styled governor(s), who simply govern an institution, such as a corporation or a bank.

"What's Earth?" a girl blurted sadly.

The professor paid no heed to the interruption and carried on.

The instructor announced timidly, "- and contains 97% of Earth's water. Another definition is 'any of the large bodies of water into which the great ocean is divided'. Separate names are used to identify five different areas of the ocean: Pacific (the largest) Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic -"

"What's Arctic?" a girl queried gently.

The instructor ignored the interruption and carried on.

The schoolteacher muttered mechanically, "- (the smallest). Seawater -"

"What's Seawater?" a girl wondered timidly.

The schoolteacher paid no heed to the interruption and continued.

The lecturer seethed sadly, "- covers approximately 361,000,000 km2 (139,000,000 sq mi) of the planet. The ocean is the principal component of Earth's hydrosphere, and therefore integral to life on Earth. Acting as a huge heat reservoir, the ocean influences climate and weather patterns, the carbon cycle, and the water cycle. Oceanographers divide the ocean into different vertical and horizontal zones based on physical and biological conditions. The pelagic zone consists of the water column from surface to ocean floor throughout the open ocean. The water column is further categorized in other zones depending on depth and on how much light is present. The photic zone includes water from the surface to a depth of 200 m, where photosynthesis can occur. This makes the photic zone the most biodiverse. Photosynthesis -"

"What's Photosynthesis?" a student said crudely.

The educator acknowledged the query with a nervous laugh.

The professor said happily, "Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy that, through cellular respiration, can later be released to fuel the organism's activities. This chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars and starches, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water – hence the name photosynthesis, from the Greek phōs (φῶς), 'light', and sunthesis (σύνθεσις), 'putting together'. In most cases, oxygen is also released as a waste product. Most plants, algae, and cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis; such organisms are called photoautotrophs. Photosynthesis is largely responsible for producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere -"

"What's Earth's atmosphere?" a boy asked confidently.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the query with a nervous laugh.

The instructor declared carefully, "The atmosphere of Earth -"

"What's Earth?" a student piped up quietly.

The professor acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The educator ignored the interruption and proceeded.

The lecturer elaborated breathlessly, "-, commonly known as air, is the layer of gases retained by Earth's gravity -"

"What's Earth's gravity?" a boy raised mechanically.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a grin.

The instructor declared breathlessly, "The gravity of Earth -"

"What's Earth?" a student blurted confidently.

The instructor acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The lecturer paid no attention to the interruption and continued.

The teacher explained sadly, "-, denoted by g, is the net acceleration that is imparted to objects due to the combined effect of gravitation (from mass distribution within Earth) and the centrifugal force (from the Earth's rotation -"

"What's Earth's rotation?" a student blurted.

The professor acknowledged the query with a nervous laugh.

The educator elaborated happily, "Earth -"

"What's Earth?" a boy demanded pointedly.

The instructor acknowledged the query with a grin.

The professor disregarded the interruption and continued.

The teacher noted mechanically, "-'s rotation or Earth's spin is the rotation of planet Earth around its own axis, as well as changes in the orientation of the rotation axis in space. Earth rotates eastward, in prograde motion. As viewed from the north pole star Polaris -"

"What's Polaris?" a student said politely.

The instructor disregarded the interruption and proceeded.

The teacher breathed quickly, "-, Earth turns counterclockwise. The North Pole -"

The teacher took a breath, expecting a question from the class about North Pole or some other topic.

The lecturer proceeded.

"Now then, returning to Gravity of Earth....", the professor sang sadly.

The pupils listened in rapt attention.

"Now then, turning back our attention to Atmosphere of Earth....", the professor declared quietly.

The pupils stifled their yawns.

"Alright, back again to Photosynthesis....", the educator explained crudely.

The students listened in rapt attention.

"Well then, turning back our attention to Ocean....", the professor elaborated calmly.

The students sat straighter in their seats.

"Alright, returning to Atlantic Ocean....", the teacher noted sadly.

The students sat straighter in their seats.

"So, getting back to Atlantic Ocean....", the lecturer sang breathlessly.

The class watched quietly.

"Okay, returning to The Bahamas....", the schoolteacher sang calmly.

The pupils suppressed giggles.

"Well then, returning to The Bahamas....", the professor declared crudely.

The class sniggered.

"Now, going back to The Bahamas....", the professor elaborated gingerly.

The pupils suppressed giggles.

"Now then, returning to The Bahamas....", the instructor muttered confidently.

The students listened in rapt attention.

"Okay, back again to The Bahamas....", the instructor seethed happily.

The class sniggered.

"So, returning to United States....", the professor murmured slowly.

The pupils stifled their yawns.

"Alright, going back to United States....", the teacher announced.

The class sat straighter in their seats.

"Well then, back again to United States....", the schoolteacher seethed aggressively.

The pupils sniggered.

"Well then, going back to Governor....", the teacher muttered robotically.

The pupils sniggered.

"Alright, returning to Governor-general....", the teacher declared happily.

The pupils sat straighter in their seats.

"Okay, getting back to Canada Act 1982....", the schoolteacher announced timidly.

The pupils listened in rapt attention.

"Now then, going back to Canada....", the teacher announced pointedly.

The students sniggered.

"Well then, back again to Éditions Robert Laffont....", the schoolteacher seethed carefully.

The class stifled their yawns.

"Okay, returning to Alexis Curvers....", the professor said carefully.

The students sniggered.

The bell sounded.

"That's all the time we have. I hope you learned something today," the professor seethed pointedly.

The pupils filed out of the room carefully.
