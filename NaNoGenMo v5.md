# Lesson 1: Psalms or Prayers

"Welcome, class! Today we'll be learning about Psalms or Prayers," the teacher noted quietly.

The students watched quietly.

The teacher declared slowly, "Psalms or Prayers was the first book published by Katherine Parr -"

"What's Katherine Parr?" a pupil said pointedly.

The professor ignored the interruption and continued.

The schoolteacher elaborated aggressively, "- Katherine Parr, queen consort of England -"

The schoolteacher paused, anticipating a query from the pupils about England or some other topic.

The pupils watched quietly.

The teacher continued.

The schoolteacher noted confidently, "- England. It is an English translation of the Latin Psalms, published by John Fisher -"

"What's John Fisher?" a pupil asked pointedly.

The professor acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The instructor announced gently, "John Fisher (c. 19 October 1469 – 22 June 1535) was an English Catholic bishop, cardinal, and theologian. Fisher was also an academic and Chancellor of the University of Cambridge -"

"What's University of Cambridge?" a boy raised pointedly.

The educator acknowledged the question with a smile.

The professor sang gingerly, "The University of Cambridge is a collegiate research university in Cambridge, United Kingdom. Founded in 1209 and granted a royal charter by Henry III in 1231, Cambridge is the second-oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world's fourth-oldest surviving university. The university grew out of an association of scholars who left the University of Oxford after a dispute with the townspeople. The two English ancient universities share many common features and are often jointly referred to as Oxbridge -"

"What's Oxbridge?" a pupil queried sadly.

The professor paid no heed to the interruption and carried on.

The lecturer announced carefully, "- Oxbridge. Cambridge is formed from a variety of institutions which include 31 semi-autonomous constituent colleges and over 150 academic departments, faculties and other institutions organised into six schools. All the colleges are self-governing institutions within the university, each controlling its own membership and with its own internal structure and activities. All students are members of a college. The university does not have a main campus, and its colleges and central facilities are scattered throughout the city. Undergraduate teaching at Cambridge centres on weekly small-group supervisions in the colleges in groups of typically 1–4 students. This intensive method of teaching is widely considered the 'jewel in the crown' of an Oxbridge undergraduate education. In addition, lectures, seminars, laboratory work and occasionally further supervisions are provided by the central university faculties and departments. Postgraduate teaching is provided predominantly centrally. Cambridge University Press -"

"What's Cambridge University Press?" a pupil quizzed gently.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a smirk.

The lecturer sang gingerly, "Cambridge -"

"What's Cambridge?" a boy questioned pointedly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The teacher noted furiously, "Cambridge ( KAYM-brij) is a university city and the county town of Cambridgeshire, England, on the River Cam approximately 55 miles (89 km) north of London -"

The educator stopped, expecting a query from the pupils about London or some other topic.

The students stifled their yawns.

The instructor continued.

The schoolteacher muttered gently, "- London. At the United Kingdom -"

The lecturer took a breath, expecting a query from the students about United Kingdom or some other topic.

The class watched quietly.

The lecturer proceeded.

The instructor murmured pointedly, "- United Kingdom Census 2011 -"

"What's United Kingdom Census 2011?" a student questioned slowly.

The professor acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The teacher sang confidently, "A census of the population of the United Kingdom is taken every ten years. The 2011 census was held in all countries of the UK on 27 March 2011. It was the first UK census which could be completed online via the Internet. The Office for National Statistics -"

"What's Office for National Statistics?" a boy raised gently.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a grin.

The schoolteacher explained breathlessly, "The Office for National Statistics (ONS; Welsh: Swyddfa Ystadegau Gwladol) is the executive office of the UK Statistics Authority, a non-ministerial department which reports directly to the UK Parliament. The ONS is responsible for the collection and publication of statistics related to the economy, population and society of the UK; responsibility for some areas of statistics in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales is devolved to the devolved governments for those areas. The ONS functions as the executive office of the National Statistician -"

The professor stopped, expecting a query from the students about National Statistician or some other topic.

The students watched quietly.

The educator proceeded.

The schoolteacher seethed gently, "- National Statistician, who is also the UK Statistics Authority's Chief Executive and principal statistical adviser to the UK's National Statistics Institute, and the 'Head Office' of the Government Statistical Service -"

"What's Government Statistical Service?" a boy piped up quietly.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a nervous laugh.

The lecturer elaborated confidently, "The Government Statistical Service (GSS) is the community of all civil servants in the United Kingdom who work in the collection, production and communication of official statistics. It includes not only statisticians, but also economists, social researchers, IT professionals, and secretarial and clerical staff. Members of the GSS work in the Office for National Statistics -"

"What's Statistics?" a girl wondered sadly.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a grin.

The teacher sang aggressively, "Statistics is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. In applying statistics to a scientific, industrial, or social problem, it is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model to be studied. Populations can be diverse groups of people or objects such as 'all people living in a country' or 'every atom composing a crystal'. Statistics deals with every aspect of data, including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments.When census data cannot be collected, statisticians collect data by developing specific experiment designs and survey samples. Representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can reasonably extend from the sample to the population as a whole. An experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study, manipulating the system, and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements. In contrast, an observational study does not involve experimental manipulation. Two main statistical methods are used in data analysis: descriptive statistics, which summarize data from a sample using indexes such as the mean or standard deviation, and inferential statistics, which draw conclusions from data that are subject to random variation (e.g., observational errors, sampling variation). Descriptive statistics -"

"What's Descriptive statistics?" a boy queried politely.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a nod.

The schoolteacher explained crudely, "A descriptive statistic (in the count noun sense) is a summary statistic that quantitatively describes or summarizes features from a collection of information, while descriptive statistics (in the mass noun sense) is the process of using and analysing those statistics. Descriptive statistics is distinguished from inferential statistics (or inductive statistics) by its aim to summarize a sample, rather than use the data to learn about the population that the sample of data is thought to represent. This generally means that descriptive statistics, unlike inferential statistics, is not developed on the basis of probability theory, and are frequently non-parametric statistics. Even when a data analysis draws its main conclusions using inferential statistics, descriptive statistics are generally also presented. For example, in papers reporting on human subjects, typically a table is included giving the overall sample size, sample sizes in important subgroups (e.g., for each treatment or exposure group), and demographic or clinical characteristics such as the average age, the proportion of subjects of each sex, the proportion of subjects with related co-morbidities, etc. Some measures that are commonly used to describe a data set are measures of central tendency and measures of variability or dispersion. Measures of central tendency include the mean, median and mode, while measures of variability include the standard deviation (or variance), the minimum and maximum values of the variables, kurtosis and skewness. Descriptive statistics provide simple summaries about the sample and about the observations that have been made. Such summaries may be either quantitative, i.e. summary statistics, or visual, i.e. simple-to-understand graphs. These summaries may either form the basis of the initial description of the data as part of a more extensive statistical analysis, or they may be sufficient in and of themselves for a particular investigation. For example, the shooting percentage in basketball is a descriptive statistic that summarizes the performance of a player or a team. This number is the number of shots made divided by the number of shots taken. For example, a player who shoots 33% is making approximately one shot in every three. The percentage summarizes or describes multiple discrete events. Consider also the grade point average. This single number describes the general performance of a student across the range of their course experiences.The use of descriptive and summary statistics has an extensive history and, indeed, the simple tabulation of populations and of economic data was the first way the topic of statistics appeared. More recently, a collection of summarisation techniques has been formulated under the heading of exploratory data analysis: an example of such a technique is the box plot. In the business world, descriptive statistics provides a useful summary of many types of data. For example, investors and brokers may use a historical account of return behaviour by performing empirical and analytical analyses on their investments in order to make better investing decisions in the future. Univariate analysis -"

"What's Univariate analysis?" a student wondered sullenly.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The instructor breathed mechanically, "Univariate -"

The schoolteacher looked around, anticipating a question from the class about Univariate or some other topic.

The pupils sat straighter in their seats.

The lecturer continued.

The instructor declared quickly, "- Univariate analysis is perhaps the simplest form of statistical analysis. Like other forms of statistics, it can be inferential or descriptive. The key fact is that only one variable is involved. Univariate analysis can yield misleading results in cases in which multivariate analysis is more appropriate. Descriptive statistics describe a sample or population. They can be part of exploratory data analysis.The appropriate statistic depends on the level of measurement. For nominal variables, a frequency table and a listing of the mode(s) is sufficient. For ordinal variables the median can be calculated as a measure of central tendency and the range (and variations of it) as a measure of dispersion. For interval level variables, the arithmetic mean (average) and standard deviation are added to the toolbox and, for ratio level variables, we add the geometric mean and harmonic mean as measures of central tendency and the coefficient of variation as a measure of dispersion. For interval and ratio level data, further descriptors include the variable's skewness and kurtosis. Inferential methods allow us to infer from a sample to a population. For a nominal variable a one-way chi-square (goodness of fit) test can help determine if our sample matches that of some population. For interval and ratio level data, a one-sample t-test can let us infer whether the mean in our sample matches some proposed number (typically 0). Other available tests of location include the one-sample sign test and Wilcoxon signed rank test -"

"What's Wilcoxon signed rank test?" a boy said.

The schoolteacher ignored the interruption and continued.

"So, going back to Descriptive statistics....", the teacher declared pointedly.

The class watched quietly.

"Well then, returning to Statistics....", the educator sang.

The class sniggered.

"Okay, returning to Government Statistical Service....", the instructor declared calmly.

The pupils sat straighter in their seats.

"Okay, getting back to Office for National Statistics....", the professor noted aggressively.

The students sat straighter in their seats.

"Now then, back again to 2011 United Kingdom census....", the educator said aggressively.

The class sat straighter in their seats.

"Well then, returning to Cambridge....", the teacher explained gingerly.

The pupils sniggered.

"Okay, turning back our attention to Cambridge University Press....", the professor elaborated gingerly.

The pupils sniggered.

"So, turning back our attention to University of Cambridge....", the teacher declared sadly.

The class sat straighter in their seats.

"Now then, turning back our attention to John Fisher....", the instructor murmured patiently.

The students stifled their yawns.

"Now, back again to Psalms or Prayers....", the instructor declared gingerly.

The pupils sniggered.

The bell blared.

"That's all the time we have. I hope you learned something today," the educator seethed slowly.

The students left the room quietly.

# Lesson 2: Ukraine at the 2004 Summer Paralympics

"Greetings, class! Today we'll be studying Ukraine at the 2004 Summer Paralympics," the lecturer declared furiously.

The students stifled their yawns.

The educator explained gingerly, "Ukraine -"

"What's Ukraine?" a pupil raised politely.

The instructor acknowledged the question with a nod.

The instructor said quickly, "Ukraine (Ukrainian: Україна, romanized: Ukraina, pronounced [ʊkrɐˈjinɐ] (listen)) is a country in Eastern Europe -"

"What's Eastern Europe?" a girl piped up carefully.

The professor acknowledged the query with a grin.

The instructor breathed sullenly, "Western Europe is the European region farthest from Asia -"

"What's Asia?" a pupil blurted slowly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the query with a smile.

The instructor declared politely, "Asia ( (listen)) is Earth -"

The educator paused, anticipating a question from the students about Earth or some other topic.

The class listened in rapt attention.

The schoolteacher proceeded.

The professor noted timidly, "- Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the Eastern and Northern Hemisphere -"

The schoolteacher paused, waiting for a question from the pupils about Northern Hemisphere or some other topic.

The pupils stifled their yawns.

The professor carried on.

The teacher murmured gently, "- Northern Hemispheres. It shares the continental landmass of Eurasia -"

The teacher paused, expecting a query from the pupils about Eurasia or some other topic.

The pupils stifled their yawns.

The teacher continued.

The professor sang mechanically, "- Eurasia with the continent of Europe -"

The lecturer looked around, expecting a query from the students about Europe or some other topic.

The pupils sniggered.

The lecturer carried on.

The lecturer breathed crudely, "- Europe and the continental landmass of Afro-Eurasia -"

"What's Afro-Eurasia?" a pupil wondered gently.

The professor acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The professor paid no heed to the interruption and continued.

The professor declared patiently, "- Afro-Eurasia with both Europe and Africa -"

"What's Africa?" a student interjected sullenly.

The schoolteacher ignored the interruption and continued.

The lecturer breathed quickly, "- Africa. Asia covers an area of 44,579,000 square kilometres (17,212,000 sq mi), about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Its 4.5 billion people (as of June 2019) constitute roughly 60% of the world's population.In general terms, Asia is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the India -"

The professor took a breath, waiting for a query from the pupils about India or some other topic.

The professor continued.

The educator declared excitedly, "- Indian Ocean -"

"What's Indian Ocean?" a pupil said breathlessly.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The professor said, "The Indian Ocean -"

"What's Ocean?" a student wondered pointedly.

The professor acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The teacher seethed gingerly, "The ocean (also the sea or the world ocean) is the body of salt water that covers approximately 70.8% of the surface of Earth -"

The schoolteacher halted, expecting a question from the class about Earth or some other topic.

The students sat straighter in their seats.

The schoolteacher continued.

The educator declared pointedly, "- Earth and contains 97% of Earth's water. Another definition is 'any of the large bodies of water into which the great ocean is divided'. Separate names are used to identify five different areas of the ocean: Pacific (the largest) Atlantic -"

"What's Atlantic?" a student queried calmly.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a smirk.

The lecturer seethed calmly, "The Atlantic -"

The professor looked around, listening for a query from the pupils about Atlantic or some other topic.

The lecturer proceeded.

The lecturer explained politely, "- Atlantic Ocean is the second-largest of the world's oceans, with an area of about 106,460,000 km2 (41,100,000 sq mi). It covers approximately 20 percent of Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It is known to separate the 'Old World -"

"What's Old World?" a girl wondered carefully.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The educator declared confidently, "The Old World -"

"What's World?" a student said confidently.

The educator acknowledged the query with a nod.

The professor elaborated quickly, "In its most general sense, the term 'world' refers to the totality of entities, to the whole of reality or to everything that is. The nature of the world has been conceptualized differently in different fields. Some conceptions see the world as unique while others talk of a 'plurality of worlds'. Some treat the world as one simple object while others analyze the world as a complex made up of many parts. In scientific cosmology the world or universe is commonly defined as '[t]he totality of all space and time; all that is, has been, and will be'. Theories of modality, on the other hand, talk of possible worlds as complete and consistent ways how things could have been. Phenomenology, starting from the horizon of co-given objects present in the periphery of every experience, defines the world as the biggest horizon or the 'horizon of all horizons'. In philosophy of mind, the world is commonly contrasted with the mind as that which is represented by the mind. Theology conceptualizes the world in relation to God, for example, as God's creation, as identical to God or as the two being interdependent. In religions, there is often a tendency to downgrade the material or sensory world in favor of a spiritual world to be sought through religious practice. A comprehensive representation of the world and our place in it, as is commonly found in religions, is known as a worldview. Cosmogony -"

"What's Cosmogony?" a pupil wondered gently.

The educator acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The teacher breathed calmly, "Cosmology (from Greek κόσμος, kosmos 'world' and -λογία, -logia 'study of') is a branch of astronomy concerned with the study of the chronology of the universe. Physical cosmology -"

"What's Physical cosmology?" a student questioned aggressively.

The professor acknowledged the query with a grin.

The professor murmured politely, "Physical cosmology is a branch of cosmology concerned with the study of cosmological models. A cosmological model, or simply cosmology, provides a description of the largest-scale structures and dynamics of the universe and allows study of fundamental questions about its origin, structure, evolution, and ultimate fate. Cosmology -"

"What's Cosmology?" a girl queried gently.

The instructor acknowledged the question with a nod.

The lecturer explained calmly, "Cosmology (from Greek κόσμος, kosmos 'world' and -λογία, -logia 'study of') is a branch of astronomy concerned with the study of the chronology of the universe. Physical cosmology -"

"What's Physical cosmology?" a boy wondered excitedly.

The schoolteacher ignored the interruption and continued.

The educator said timidly, "- Physical cosmology is the study of the universe's origin, its large-scale structures and dynamics, and the ultimate fate of the universe, including the laws of science that govern these areas.The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation myths and eschatology. Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that cannot be tested. Cosmology differs from astronomy in that the former is concerned with the Universe as a whole while the latter deals with individual celestial objects. Modern physical cosmology is dominated by the Big Bang -"

"What's Big Bang?" a pupil piped up timidly.

The instructor paid no heed to the interruption and continued.

"Now then, turning back our attention to Physical cosmology....", the professor breathed confidently.

The class sat straighter in their seats.

"Now then, getting back to Cosmology....", the educator declared aggressively.

The class suppressed giggles.

"Well then, turning back our attention to World....", the instructor muttered mechanically.

The pupils suppressed giggles.

"Alright, returning to Old World....", the schoolteacher declared patiently.

The class watched quietly.

"So, returning to Atlantic Ocean....", the professor declared gingerly.

The class listened in rapt attention.

"Well then, turning back our attention to Ocean....", the teacher breathed slowly.

The pupils listened in rapt attention.

"Now, back again to Indian Ocean....", the instructor noted sullenly.

The class watched quietly.

"Now then, going back to Asia....", the instructor noted robotically.

The students suppressed giggles.

"Now, getting back to Western Europe....", the instructor seethed sullenly.

The students stifled their yawns.

"Now, going back to Ukraine....", the professor noted patiently.

The class suppressed giggles.

"Alright, returning to Ukraine at the 2004 Summer Paralympics....", the lecturer sang calmly.

The students listened in rapt attention.

The instructor seethed calmly, "- Ukraine sent a delegation of 90 athletes to the 2004 Summer Paralympics, covering nine sports. = = = = = = = = = = = = = = Yevhan Zhuchynin Ihor Kosenko -"

"What's Ihor Kosenko?" a boy wondered sullenly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the query with a smile.

The teacher declared gently, "Ihor Kosenko (Ukrainian: Ігор Косенко, born 3 November 1977) is a Ukrainian Paralympic footballer who won a gold medal at the 2008 Summer Paralympics -"

The educator took a breath, anticipating a query from the pupils about 2008 Summer Paralympics or some other topic.

The students sniggered.

The professor continued.

The lecturer seethed politely, "- 2008 Summer Paralympics in China. Ihor Kosenko is a recipient of various Order of Merit awards, including: Order of Merit, 1st class (2008) Order of Merit, 2nd class (2004) Order of Merit, 3rd class (2003) Order For Courage -"

"What's Order For Courage?" a boy raised pointedly.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The teacher said slowly, "The Order for Courage (Ukrainian: Орден «За мужність») is the Ukrainian award, established by Ukrainian president Leonid Kuchma on August 21, 1996. The author is Ukrainian artist Mykola Lebid -"

The schoolteacher paused, listening for a query from the pupils about Mykola Lebid or some other topic.

The class sniggered.

The instructor proceeded.

The educator muttered sullenly, "- Mykola Lebid. Before August, 1996, personal bravery had been honoured with Awards of the President of Ukraine -"

"What's Ukraine?" a boy questioned happily.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the query with a grin.

The schoolteacher explained excitedly, "Ukraine (Ukrainian: Україна, romanized: Ukraina, pronounced [ʊkrɐˈjinɐ] (listen)) is a country in Eastern Europe -"

"What's Europe?" a boy raised mechanically.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a nod.

The teacher explained politely, "Euro -"

The professor took a breath, listening for a query from the students about Euro or some other topic.

The class stifled their yawns.

The lecturer carried on.

The professor announced slowly, "- Europe is a landmass located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere -"

"What's Northern Hemisphere?" a student queried quickly.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a smile.

The lecturer murmured excitedly, "The North -"

"What's North?" a pupil demanded gently.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The instructor sang furiously, "Birth -"

"What's Cattle?" a student blurted mechanically.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The schoolteacher muttered breathlessly, "A castle is a type of fortified structure built during the Middle Ages -"

"What's Middle Ages?" a girl queried calmly.

The professor paid no heed to the interruption and proceeded.

The instructor announced slowly, "- Middle Ages predominantly by the nobility or royalty and by military orders. Scholars debate the scope of the word castle, but usually consider it to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble. This is distinct from a palace, which is not fortified; from a fortress, which was not always a residence for royalty or nobility; from a ‘pleasance’ which was a walled-in residence for nobility, but not adequately fortified; and from a fortified settlement, which was a public defence – though there are many similarities among these types of construction. Use of the term has varied over time and has been applied to structures as diverse as hill forts and country houses. Over the approximately 900 years that castles were built, they took on a great many forms with many different features, although some, such as curtain walls, arrowslits, and portcullises, were commonplace. Europe -"

"What's Europe?" a girl said carefully.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a smile.

The educator sang robotically, "Euro -"

"What's Euro?" a boy queried quickly.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a grin.

The educator took a breath, waiting for a question from the class about Equator or some other topic.

The pupils sat straighter in their seats.

The educator continued.

The educator noted timidly, "- Equator. For other planets in the Solar System -"

"What's Solar System?" a student questioned aggressively.

The professor halted, expecting a question from the class about Belarus or some other topic.

The professor continued.

"Now then, returning to Order for Courage....", the lecturer explained happily.

The pupils suppressed giggles.

The professor announced timidly, "- Ukraine for Courage: the Star for Courage and the Cross for Courage instituted on April 29, 1995. On August 21, 1996, they were transformed into three classes of the Order for Courage. Recipients of Awards of the President of Ukraine, such as the Star for Courage and the Cross for Courage, are considered to be equal to the recipients of the Order for Courage and they are recognised as holders of the Order for Courage retaining the right to wear decorations that have been granted. Granting the Star For Courage and the Cross for Courage was discontinued following the institution of the Order for Courage. Viktor Gurniak -"

"What's Viktor Gurniak?" a girl raised quickly.

The educator acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The 326 Indian reservations in the United States are associated with specific Native American nations, often on a one-to-one basis. Some of the country's 574 federally recognized tribes govern more than one reservation, while some share reservations, and others have no reservation at all. In addition, because of past land allotments, leading to sales to non–Native Americans, some reservations are severely fragmented, with each piece of tribal, individual, and privately held land being a separate enclave. This jumble of private and public real estate creates significant administrative, political and legal difficulties.The collective geographical area of all reservations is 56,200,000 acres (22,700,000 ha; 87,800 sq mi; 227,000 km2), approximately the size of the state of Idaho -"

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The professor said happily, "The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) is an intergovernmental organization representing hydrography. In January 2021 the IHO comprised 94 Member States. A principal aim of the IHO is to ensure that the world's seas, oceans and navigable waters are properly surveyed and charted. It does this through the setting of international standards, the co-ordination of the endeavors of the world's national hydrographic offices, and through its capacity building program. The IHO enjoys observer status at the United Nations, where it is the recognized competent authority on hydrographic surveying and nautical charting. When referring to hydrography and nautical charting in Conventions and similar Instruments, it is the IHO standards and specifications that are normally used. The IHO was established in 1921 as the International Hydrographic Bureau (IHB). The present name was adopted in 1970, as part of a new international Convention on the IHO adopted by the then member nations. The former name International Hydrographic Bureau was retained to describe the IHO secretariat until 8 November 2016, when a revision to the Convention on the IHO entered into force. Thereafter the IHB became known as the 'IHO Secretariat', comprising an elected Secretary-General and two supporting Directors, together with a small permanent staff (17 as at August 2019), at the Organization's headquarters in Monaco. During the 19th century, many maritime nations established hydrographic offices to provide means for improving the navigation of naval and merchant vessels by providing nautical publications, nautical charts, and other navigational services. There were substantial differences in hydrographic procedures charts, and publications. In 1889, an International Maritime Conference was held at Washington, D.C., and it was proposed to establish a 'permanent international commission.'

The purpose of such sending off is usually to convey a message, and thus 'messenger' is a common alternative translation; other common translations include 'ambassador' and 'envoy'.The term derives from the Greek of the New Testament and was used for Jesus -"

"What's Jesus?" a student wondered timidly.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a nod.

The lecturer noted robotically, "The Arctic -"

"What's Arctic?" a girl wondered sadly.

The professor acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The educator paid no heed to the interruption and carried on.

The teacher muttered slowly, "- Arctic Ocean -"

"What's Ocean?" a student questioned sullenly.

The instructor acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The instructor sang quietly, "The ocean (also the sea or the world ocean) is the body of salt water that covers approximately 70.8% of the surface of Earth and contains 97% of Earth's water. Another definition is 'any of the large bodies of water into which the great ocean is divided'. Separate names are used to identify five different areas of the ocean: Pacific (the largest) Atlantic -"

"What's Atlantic?" a boy asked quickly.

The schoolteacher noted slowly, "- Arctic (the smallest). Sea -"

The professor took a breath, listening for a question from the class about Sea or some other topic.

The pupils stifled their yawns.

The lecturer continued.

The instructor muttered patiently, "- Seawater covers approximately 361,000,000 km2 (139,000,000 sq mi) of the planet. The ocean is the principal component of Earth's hydrosphere, and therefore integral to life on Earth. Acting as a huge heat reservoir, the ocean influences climate and weather patterns, the carbon cycle, and the water cycle. Oceanographers divide the ocean into different vertical and horizontal zones based on physical and biological conditions. The pelagic zone consists of the water column from surface to ocean floor throughout the open ocean. The water column is further categorized in other zones depending on depth and on how much light is present. The photic zone includes water from the surface to a depth of 1% of the surface light (about 200 m in the open ocean), where photosynthesis can occur. This makes the photic zone the most biodiverse. Photosynthesis -"

"What's Photosynthesis?" a boy raised sullenly.

The instructor ignored the interruption and proceeded.

"Now, going back to Atlantic Ocean....", the educator muttered gingerly.

The class suppressed giggles.

The lecturer paid no attention to the interruption and carried on.

"So, turning back our attention to Ocean....", the lecturer elaborated calmly.

The pupils sniggered.

"Now, going back to Arctic Ocean....", the schoolteacher seethed gently.

The pupils suppressed giggles.

The lecturer seethed, "- Ocean is the smallest and shallowest of the world's five major oceans. It spans an area of approximately 14,060,000 km2 (5,430,000 sq mi) and is also known as the coldest of all the oceans. The International Hydrographic Organization -"

"What's International Hydrographic Organization?" a pupil blurted breathlessly.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a smile.

The lecturer explained crudely, "The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) is an intergovernmental organization representing hydrography. In January 2021 the IHO comprised 94 Member States. A principal aim of the IHO is to ensure that the world's seas, oceans and navigable waters are properly surveyed and charted. It does this through the setting of international standards, the co-ordination of the endeavors of the world's national hydrographic offices, and through its capacity building program. The IHO enjoys observer status at the United Nations, where it is the recognized competent authority on hydrographic surveying and nautical charting. When referring to hydrography and nautical charting in Conventions and similar Instruments, it is the IHO standards and specifications that are normally used. The IHO was established in 1921 as the International Hydrographic Bureau (IHB). The present name was adopted in 1970, as part of a new international Convention on the IHO adopted by the then member nations. The former name International Hydrographic Bureau was retained to describe the IHO secretariat until 8 November 2016, when a revision to the Convention on the IHO entered into force. Thereafter the IHB became known as the 'IHO Secretariat', comprising an elected Secretary-General and two supporting Directors, together with a small permanent staff (17 as at August 2019), at the Organization's headquarters in Monaco. During the 19th century, many maritime nations established hydrographic offices to provide means for improving the navigation of naval and merchant vessels by providing nautical publications, nautical charts, and other navigational services. There were substantial differences in hydrographic procedures charts, and publications. In 1889, an International Maritime Conference was held at Washington, D.C. -"

"What's Washington, D.C.?" a student interjected quietly.

The educator acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The lecturer paid no attention to the interruption and continued.

"What's Christendom?" a student piped up quietly.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The schoolteacher announced patiently, "Christ -"

"What's Christ?" a boy wondered quickly.

The educator acknowledged the query with a nervous laugh.

The educator elaborated slowly, "Chris is a short form of various names including Christopher, Christian, Christina, Christine, and Christos. Chris is also used as a name in its own right, however it is not as common. Chris Abani (born 1966), Nigerian author Chris Abrahams -"

"What's Chris Abrahams?" a pupil quizzed timidly.

The professor acknowledged the question with a smirk.

The teacher explained patiently, "Christopher Robert Lionel Abrahams (born 9 April 1961) is a New Zealand pianist, best known for his jazz work. Abrahams has been a member of the Benders -"

The lecturer halted, expecting a question from the students about Benders or some other topic.

The schoolteacher proceeded.

"What's Hammond organ?" a pupil asked sadly.

The educator paid no heed to the interruption and proceeded.

The instructor seethed crudely, "- Hammond organ, Tony Buck on drums, percussion and electric guitar, and Lloyd Swanton -"

"What's Lloyd Swanton?" a boy interjected pointedly.

The professor acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The professor said politely, "Lloyd Stuart Swanton (born 14 August 1960) is an Australian jazz double bassist, bass guitarist, and composer.Swanton was a member of Dynamic Hepnotics -"

"What's Dynamic Hepnotics?" a boy wondered excitedly.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a nod.

The educator declared, "The Dynamic Hepnotics were an Australian soul, blues and funk band which formed in 1979 and disbanded in 1986. Mainstay, lead vocalist and front man, 'Continental' Robert Susz formed the group in Sydney. They had chart success on the Australian Kent Music Report -"

"What's Kent Music Report?" a girl said robotically.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The instructor noted carefully, "The Kent Music Report was a weekly record chart of Australia -"

The professor looked around, waiting for a question from the class about Australia or some other topic.

The students stifled their yawns.

The educator carried on.

The professor announced quickly, "- Australian music singles and albums which was compiled by music enthusiast David Kent from May 1974 through to January 1999. The chart was re-branded the Australian Music Report (AMR) in July 1987. From June 1988, the Australian Recording Industry Association -"

The teacher took a breath, anticipating a question from the class about Australian Recording Industry Association or some other topic.

The schoolteacher breathed politely, "Alfred DuPont Chandler Jr. (September 15, 1918 – May 9, 2007) was a professor of business history at Harvard Business School -"

"What's Harvard Business School?" a student piped up sadly.

The professor acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The educator murmured quietly, "Harvard Business School (HBS) is the graduate business school of Harvard University in Boston -"

"What's MBA?" a student said calmly.

The professor acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The lecturer seethed crudely, "The National Basketball -"

"What's Basketball?" a student queried quickly.

The professor acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The schoolteacher murmured happily, "Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated. Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate, both of which require considerable skill. On offense, players may use a variety of shots – the layup, the jump shot, or a dunk; on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots; either offense or defense may collect a rebound, that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard. It is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling. The five players on each side fall into five playing positions. The tallest player is usually the center, the second-tallest and strongest is the power forward, a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward, and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard, who implements the coach's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays (player positioning). Informally, players may play three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one. Invented in 1891 by Canadian-America -"

"What's America?" a student blurted aggressively.

The instructor acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The class sniggered.

The schoolteacher continued.

The lecturer seethed confidently, "- Alaska Natives, and administering and managing over 55,700,000 acres (225,000 km2) of land held in trust by the U.S. federal government for Indian Tribes. It renders services to roughly 2 million indigenous Americans across 574 federally recognized tribes. The BIA is governed by a director and overseen by the assistant secretary for Indian affairs, who answers to the secretary of the interior. The BIA works with tribal governments to help administer law enforcement and justice; promote development in agriculture, infrastructure, and the economy; enhance tribal governance; manage natural resources; and generally advance the quality of life in tribal communities. Educational services are provided by Bureau of Indian Education -"

"What's Bureau of Indian Education?" a boy blurted gently.

The professor paid no heed to the interruption and carried on.

The professor declared, "- Bureau of Indian Education—the only other agency under the assistant secretary for Indian affairs—while health care is the responsibility of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services -"

The teacher paid no heed to the interruption and proceeded.

The schoolteacher declared patiently, "- Bureau of Indian Affairs, rather than by the government of the state in which it is located. The 326 Indian reservations in the United States -"

The lecturer took a breath, anticipating a question from the pupils about United States or some other topic.

The pupils sat straighter in their seats.

The instructor continued.

The professor breathed pointedly, "- United States are associated with specific Native American nations, often on a one-to-one basis. Some of the country's 574 federally recognized tribes govern more than one reservation, while some share reservations, and others have no reservation at all. In addition, because of past land allotments, leading to sales to non–Native Americans, some reservations are severely fragmented, with each piece of tribal, individual, and privately held land being a separate enclave. This jumble of private and public real estate creates significant administrative, political and legal difficulties.The collective geographical area of all reservations is 56,200,000 acres (22,700,000 ha; 87,800 sq mi; 227,000 km2), approximately the size of the state of Idaho -"

The professor breathed timidly, "- US), officially the United States of America -"

The lecturer took a breath, anticipating a query from the class about America or some other topic.

The educator continued.

The educator seethed, "- America (U.S.A. or USA) and commonly known as America, is a country primarily located in North America. It consists of 50 states, a federal district, five major unincorporated territories, 326 Indian reservation -"

The teacher paused, waiting for a question from the students about Indian reservation or some other topic.

"What's Earth?" a boy queried quietly.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The lecturer paid no attention to the interruption and proceeded.

The educator seethed furiously, "- Earth and contains 97% of Earth's water. Another definition is 'any of the large bodies of water into which the great ocean is divided'. Separate names are used to identify five different areas of the ocean: Pacific (the largest) Atlantic -"

"What's Atlantic?" a pupil interjected pointedly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The educator announced furiously, "The Atlantic Ocean -"

"What's Ocean?" a boy wondered politely.

The teacher paid no attention to the interruption and continued.

The schoolteacher explained mechanically, "- Ocean is the second-largest of the world's oceans, with an area of about 106,460,000 km2 (41,100,000 sq mi). It covers approximately 20 percent of Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It is known to separate the 'Old World -"

"What's Old World?" a girl interjected furiously.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The instructor declared pointedly, "The Old World -"

"What's World?" a pupil blurted gingerly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a smirk.

The lecturer noted furiously, "In its most general sense, the term 'world' refers to the totality of entities, to the whole of reality or to everything that is. The nature of the world has been conceptualized differently in different fields. Some conceptions see the world as unique while others talk of a 'plurality of worlds'. Some treat the world as one simple object while others analyze the world as a complex made up of many parts. In scientific cosmology the world or universe is commonly defined as '[t]he totality of all space and time; all that is, has been, and will be'. Theories of modality, on the other hand, talk of possible worlds as complete and consistent ways how things could have been. Phenomenology, starting from the horizon of co-given objects present in the periphery of every experience, defines the world as the biggest horizon or the 'horizon of all horizons'. In philosophy of mind, the world is commonly contrasted with the mind as that which is represented by the mind. Theology conceptualizes the world in relation to God, for example, as God's creation, as identical to God or as the two being interdependent. In religions, there is often a tendency to downgrade the material or sensory world in favor of a spiritual world to be sought through religious practice. A comprehensive representation of the world and our place in it, as is commonly found in religions, is known as a worldview. Cosmogony -"

"What's Cosmogony?" a girl demanded calmly.

The lecturer paid no heed to the interruption and proceeded.

"Now then, back again to Old World....", the schoolteacher noted carefully.

The students listened in rapt attention.

"What's Straits?" a boy piped up slowly.

Some straits are not navigable, for example because they are too shallow, or because of an unnavigable reef or archipelago. Straits are also known to be loci for sediment accumulation. Usually, sand-size deposits occur on both the two opposite strait exits, forming subaqueous fans or deltas. The terms channel, pass, or passage can be synonymous and used interchangeably with strait, although each is sometimes differentiated with varying senses. In Scotland -"

The schoolteacher paused, anticipating a query from the pupils about French Republic or some other topic.

The professor carried on.

The lecturer sang crudely, "- French Republic -"

"What's Republic?" a boy demanded quietly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the query with a grin.

The professor muttered happily, "A republic (from Latin res publica 'public affair') is a form of government in which 'power is held by the people and their elected representatives'. In republics, the country is considered a 'public matter', not the private concern or property of the rulers. The primary positions of power within a republic are attained through democracy or a mix of democracy with oligarchy or autocracy rather than being unalterably occupied by any given family lineage or group. With modern republicanism, it has become the opposing form of government to a monarchy and therefore a modern republic has no monarch as head of state.As of 2017, 159 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word 'republic' as part of their official names. Not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor is the word 'republic' used in the names of all states with elected governments. The word republic comes from the Latin term res publica, which literally means 'public thing', 'public matter', or 'public affair' and was used to refer to the state as a whole. The term developed its modern meaning in reference to the constitution of the ancient Roman Republic, lasting from the overthrow of the kings in 509 BC to the establishment of the Empire -"

"What's Empire?" a student asked furiously.

The teacher paid no heed to the interruption and carried on.

The instructor announced sadly, "- Empire in 27 BC. This constitution was characterized by a Senate composed of wealthy aristocrats wielding significant influence; several popular assemblies of all free citizens, possessing the power to elect magistrates and pass laws; and a series of magistracies with varying types of civil and political authority. Most often a republic is a single sovereign state, but there are also sub-sovereign state entities that are referred to as republics, or that have governments that are described as republican in nature. For instance, the United States -"

The schoolteacher took a breath, expecting a query from the pupils about United States or some other topic.

The pupils sat straighter in their seats.

The professor proceeded.

The instructor muttered confidently, "- United States Constitution 'guarantee[s] to every State in this Union a Republican form of Government'. Another example was the Soviet Union, which described itself as being a federation of 'Soviet Socialist Republics -"

"What's Soviet Socialist Republics?" a student raised breathlessly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The teacher announced gently, "The Republics of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics or the Union Republics (Russia -"

"What's Russia?" a pupil interjected robotically.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a grin.

The teacher sang carefully, "Russia (Russian: Россия, Rossiya, Russian pronunciation: [rɐˈsʲijə]), or the Russian Federation -"

"What's Federation?" a student demanded timidly.

The professor acknowledged the query with a nervous laugh.

The lecturer elaborated politely, "A federation (also known as a federal state) is a political entity characterized by a union of partially self-governing provinces, states, or other regions under a central federal government (federalism). In a federation, the self-governing status of the component states, as well as the division of power between them and the central government, is typically constitutionally entrenched and may not be altered by a unilateral decision of either party, the states or the federal political body. Alternatively, a federation is a form of government in which sovereign power is formally divided between a central authority and a number of constituent regions so that each region retains some degree of control over its internal affairs. It is often argued that federal states where the central government has overriding powers are not truly federal states. For example, such overriding powers may include: the constitutional authority to suspend a constituent state's government by invoking gross mismanagement or civil unrest, or to adopt national legislation that overrides or infringes on the constituent states' powers by invoking the central government's constitutional authority to ensure 'peace and good government' or to implement obligations contracted under an international treaty. The governmental or constitutional structure found in a federation is considered to be federalist, or to be an example of federalism. It can be considered the opposite of another system, the unitary state. France -"

The schoolteacher stopped, anticipating a query from the class about France or some other topic.

The class sniggered.

The instructor proceeded.

The professor breathed sadly, "- France, for example, has been unitary for many centuries. Austria -"

"What's Austria?" a pupil questioned breathlessly.

The instructor paid no attention to the interruption and carried on.

The professor murmured calmly, "- Austria and its Län -"

"What's Län?" a pupil piped up sullenly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a grin.

The pupils sniggered.

The teacher sang sadly, "- Federation, is a transcontinental country spanning Eastern Europe -"

"What's Eastern Europe?" a girl asked happily.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a nod.

The schoolteacher said robotically, "Western Europe -"

"What's Europe?" a girl wondered mechanically.

The schoolteacher paid no attention to the interruption and proceeded.

The instructor breathed breathlessly, "- Europe is the European region farthest from Asia. The region's countries and territories vary depending on context. Beginning with foreign exploration during the Age of Discovery, roughly from the 15th century, the concept of Europe as 'the West' gradually became distinguished from and eventually replaced the dominant use of 'Christendom' as the preferred endonym within the region. Later, during the Age of Enlightenment -"

The professor halted, listening for a question from the class about Age of Enlightenment or some other topic.

The instructor continued.

The educator murmured mechanically, "- Age of Enlightenment, the concept of 'Eastern Europe -"

The teacher looked around, expecting a question from the students about Eastern Europe or some other topic.

The instructor stopped, waiting for a query from the pupils about La Tène culture or some other topic.

The pupils suppressed giggles.

The educator continued.

The lecturer sang politely, "- La Tène culture. As the Roman domain expanded, a cultural and linguistic division appeared between the mainly Greek-speaking eastern provinces, which had formed the highly urbanized Hellenistic civilization, and the western territories, which in contrast largely adopted the Latin language -"

"What's Latin language?" a girl wondered breathlessly.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a nervous laugh.

The lecturer breathed aggressively, "Latin (latīnum, [laˈt̪iːnʊ̃] or lingua latīna, [ˈlɪŋɡʷa laˈt̪iːna]) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. Latin was originally spoken in the area around Rome -"

The lecturer paused, expecting a question from the students about Rome or some other topic.

The students watched quietly.

The instructor carried on.

The professor declared aggressively, "- Rome, known as Latium -"

The instructor took a breath, listening for a query from the pupils about Latium or some other topic.

The professor took a breath, waiting for a question from the pupils about Roman Empire or some other topic.

The educator carried on.

The professor announced furiously, "- Roman Empire, Rome -"

"What's Rome?" a boy raised carefully.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a nod.

The professor ignored the interruption and continued.

The professor elaborated politely, "- Rome's control rapidly expanded during this period—from the city's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world. Roman society under the Republic was primarily a cultural mix of Latin and Etruscan societies, as well as of Sabine, Oscan, and Greek cultural elements, which is especially visible in the Roman Pantheon. Its political organization developed at around the same time as direct democracy in Ancient Greece -"

"What's Ancient Greece?" a pupil interjected quickly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a nod.

The lecturer declared furiously, "Ancient Greece (Greek: Ἑλλάς, romanized: Hellás) was a northeastern Mediterranean -"

"What's Mediterranean?" a pupil wondered aggressively.

The professor acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The professor announced crudely, "The Mediterranean Sea -"

"What's Sea?" a pupil blurted excitedly.

The instructor acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The instructor disregarded the interruption and proceeded.

"What's Ocean?" a girl questioned.

"What's Earth?" a boy wondered timidly.

The instructor acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The schoolteacher disregarded the interruption and proceeded.

The lecturer sang robotically, "- Earth and contains 97% of Earth's water. Another definition is 'any of the large bodies of water into which the great ocean is divided'. Separate names are used to identify five different areas of the ocean: Pacific (the largest) Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic (the smallest). Seawater -"

"What's Seawater?" a pupil said pointedly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a nod.

The lecturer announced sullenly, "Sea -"

The teacher looked around, anticipating a question from the pupils about Sea or some other topic.

The lecturer carried on.

The instructor said calmly, "- Seawater, or salt water, is water from a sea or ocean. On average, seawater in the world's oceans has a salinity of about 3.5% (35 g/l, 35 ppt, 600 mM). This means that every kilogram (roughly one liter by volume) of seawater has approximately 35 grams (1.2 oz) of dissolved salts (predominantly sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl−) ions). Average density at the surface is 1.025 kg/l. Seawater is denser than both fresh water and pure water (density 1.0 kg/l at 4 °C (39 °F)) because the dissolved salts increase the mass by a larger proportion than the volume. In comparison, most human physiological saline levels are approximately one quarter of this, for example blood is 9g/l (0.9% w/v). The freezing point of seawater decreases as salt concentration increases. At typical salinity, it freezes at about −2 °C (28 °F). The coldest seawater still in the liquid state ever recorded was found in 2010, in a stream under an Antarctic -"

"What's Antarctic?" a student wondered happily.

In republics, the country is considered a 'public matter', not the private concern or property of the rulers. The primary positions of power within a republic are attained through democracy or a mix of democracy with oligarchy or autocracy rather than being unalterably occupied by any given family lineage or group. With modern republicanism, it has become the opposing form of government to a monarchy and therefore a modern republic has no monarch as head of state.As of 2017, 159 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word 'republic' as part of their official names. Not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor is the word 'republic' used in the names of all states with elected governments. The word republic comes from the Latin term res publica, which literally means 'public thing', 'public matter', or 'public affair' and was used to refer to the state as a whole.

The professor continued.

The instructor sang mechanically, "- Seawater covers approximately 361,000,000 km2 (139,000,000 sq mi) of the planet. The ocean is the principal component of Earth's hydrosphere, and therefore integral to life on Earth. Acting as a huge heat reservoir, the ocean influences climate and weather patterns, the carbon cycle, and the water cycle. Oceanographers divide the ocean into different vertical and horizontal zones based on physical and biological conditions. The pelagic zone consists of the water column from surface to ocean floor throughout the open ocean. The water column is further categorized in other zones depending on depth and on how much light is present. The photic zone includes water from the surface to a depth of 1% of the surface light (about 200 m in the open ocean), where photosynthesis can occur. This makes the photic zone the most biodiverse. Photosynthesis -"

"What's Photosynthesis?" a girl quizzed gently.

The educator disregarded the interruption and carried on.

The lecturer declared mechanically, "- Photosynthesis by plants and microscopic algae (free floating phytoplankton) creates organic matter using light, water, carbon dioxide, and nutrients. Ocean photosynthesis creates 50% of the oxygen in earth's atmosphere. This upper sunlit zone is the origin of the food supply which sustains most of the ocean ecosystem. Light only penetrates to a depth of a few hundred meters; the remaining ocean below is cold and dark. The continental shelf where the ocean approaches dry land is more shallow, with a depth of a few hundred meters or less. Human activity has a greater impact on the continental shelf. Ocean temperatures depend on the amount of solar radiation reaching the ocean surface. In the tropics, surface temperatures can rise to over 30 °C (86 °F). Near the poles where sea ice forms, the temperature in equilibrium is about −2 °C (28 °F). Deep seawater temperature is between −2 °C (28 °F) and 5 °C (41 °F) in all parts of the ocean. Water -"

"What's Lyricon?" a girl raised furiously.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The instructor breathed calmly, "The Lyricon is an electronic wind instrument, the first wind controller to be constructed. Invented by Bill Bernardi (and co-engineered by Roger Noble and with the late Lyricon performer Chuck Greenberg), it was manufactured by Computone Inc. in Massachusetts in the early 1970s. The Lyricon was available in two designs, the first being somewhat silver and resembling a soprano saxophone and the latter, black and resembling an alto clarinet. Using a form of additive synthesis, the player was allowed to change between types of overtones with a key switchable between fundamentals of G, Bb, C, Eb, and F (allowing the instrument to be used to play transposed parts written for saxophones, trumpets, etc.) and an octave range that could be switched between low, medium, or high. The instrument also had controls for glissando, portamento, and 'timbre attack' (a type of chorusing). The Lyricon used a bass clarinet mouthpiece, with a sprung metal sensor on the (non-vibrating) reed that detected lip pressure. Wind pressure was detected by a diaphragm, which moved and changed the light output from an LED, which was in turn sensed by a photocell to give dynamic control. Two additional re-modelled Lyricons were engineered later. First the 'Wind Synthesizer Driver', which had control voltage outputs for lip pressure, wind pressure and pitch, to control the VCA and VCF and pitch of an external analog synthesizer. Then the 'Lyricon II' was engineered, which included a two-oscillator synthesizer. All the Lyricons used the same saxophone style fingering system, with two octave keys above the left-hand thumb rest. The Wind Synthesizer Driver and the Lyricon II also had a transposition footswitch feature, where a foot pedal could be used to transpose the entire range up or down one octave. None of the Lyricons were engineered to use MIDI -"

"What's MIDI?" a pupil quizzed slowly.

The educator acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The lecturer paid no heed to the interruption and carried on.

The professor explained mechanically, "- MIDI (which was invented after Computone went out of business in 1980), although external MIDIfication modules were produced by JL Cooper and STEIM. The design of the Lyricon controller was later borrowed to form the basis for Yamaha's WX-series MIDI wind controllers.

Walters -"

"What's John L. Walters?" a student wondered excitedly.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The educator explained excitedly, "John L. Walters (born 16 April 1953) is an English editor, musician, critic and composer. John L. Walters was born in Chesterfield, Derbyshire -"

The lecturer took a breath, listening for a query from the class about Derbyshire or some other topic.

The instructor sang timidly, "The United Kingdom of Great Britain -"

"What's Kingdom of Great Britain?" a boy raised patiently.

The instructor acknowledged the question with a smile.

The teacher breathed mechanically, "The Kingdom of Great Britain -"

"What's Great Britain?" a pupil wondered crudely.

The educator acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The professor muttered excitedly, "Great Britain is an island in the North Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of 209,331 km2 (80,823 sq mi), it is the largest of the British Isles -"

The lecturer halted, anticipating a question from the students about British Isles or some other topic.

The students stifled their yawns.

The schoolteacher carried on.

The schoolteacher breathed timidly, "- British Isles, the largest European island, and the ninth-largest island in the world. The island is dominated by a maritime climate with narrow temperature differences between seasons. The 60% smaller island of Ireland -"

"What's Ireland?" a girl said gingerly.

The educator acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The lecturer elaborated politely, "An island or isle is any piece of subcontinental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. Sedimentary islands in the Ganges delta -"

The educator explained patiently, "- Bengali: বাংলাদেশ, pronounced [ˈbaŋlaˌdeʃ] (listen)), officially the People's Republic -"

"What's Republic?" a boy piped up aggressively.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The lecturer murmured gently, "A republic (from Latin res publica 'public affair') is a form of government in which 'power is held by the people and their elected representatives'. In republics, the country is considered a 'public matter', not the private concern or property of the rulers. The primary positions of power within a republic are attained through democracy or a mix of democracy with oligarchy or autocracy rather than being unalterably occupied by any given family lineage or group. With modern republicanism, it has become the opposing form of government to a monarchy and therefore a modern republic has no monarch as head of state.As of 2017, 159 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word 'republic' as part of their official names. Not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor is the word 'republic' used in the names of all states with elected governments. The word republic comes from the Latin term res publica, which literally means 'public thing', 'public matter', or 'public affair' and was used to refer to the state as a whole. The term developed its modern meaning in reference to the constitution of the ancient Roman Republic, lasting from the overthrow of the kings in 509 BC to the establishment of the Empire -"

The instructor took a breath, anticipating a question from the students about Empire or some other topic.

The students listened in rapt attention.

In particular, it denotes publications of this type distributed by university administrations at the start of the academic year, with the intention of helping students get to know each other. College -"

"What's College?" a girl queried sadly.

The professor acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The professor noted quickly, "A college (Latin -"

"What's Latin?" a girl blurted timidly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The instructor declared gently, "Latin (latīnum, [laˈt̪iːnʊ̃] or lingua latīna, [ˈlɪŋɡʷa laˈt̪iːna]) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. Latin was originally spoken in the area around Rome -"

The teacher took a breath, waiting for a question from the pupils about Rome or some other topic.

The schoolteacher carried on.

The educator explained quietly, "- Rome, known as Latium -"

"What's Latium?" a student said gingerly.

The teacher acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The educator disregarded the interruption and proceeded.

The instructor declared quietly, "- Latium. Through the power of the Roman Republic -"

"What's Roman Republic?" a pupil questioned crudely.

The professor acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The schoolteacher elaborated breathlessly, "The Roman Republic (Latin: Rēs pūblica Rōmāna [ˈreːs ˈpuːblika roːˈmaːna]) was a state of the classical Roman civilization, run through public representation of the Roman people -"

The professor halted, waiting for a question from the class about Roman people or some other topic.

The instructor continued.

The instructor elaborated excitedly, "- Roman people. Beginning with the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom -"

"What's Roman Kingdom?" a girl quizzed pointedly.

The educator acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The lecturer said excitedly, "The Roman Kingdom, also referred to as the Roman monarchy, or the regal period of ancient Rome, was the earliest period of Roman history, when the city and its territory were ruled by kings. Little is certain about the kingdom's history, as no records and few inscriptions from the time of the kings survive, and the accounts of this period written during the Republic and the Empire are thought to be based on oral tradition. According to these legends, the Roman Kingdom began with the city's founding c. 753 BC, with settlements around the Palatine Hill along the river Tiber -"

"What's Tiber?" a student wondered quietly.

The schoolteacher acknowledged the query with a grin.

The teacher seethed confidently, "Tibet ( (listen); Tibetan: བོད་, Lhasa dialect: [/pʰøː˨˧˩/]; Chinese: 西藏; pinyin: Xīzàng) is a region in East Asia -"

"What's East Asia?" a girl quizzed quickly.

The professor acknowledged the query with a smile.

The educator elaborated timidly, "East Asia, sometimes defined geographically as Northeast Asia -"

The educator stopped, anticipating a question from the pupils about Northeast Asia or some other topic.

The educator continued.

The instructor murmured patiently, "- Northeast Asia and abbreviated as EA or NEA, is along with Southeast Asia located at the far eastern regions of Asia, which is defined in both geographical and ethno-cultural terms.The modern states of East Asia include China -"

"What's China?" a girl raised carefully.

The professor acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The instructor said quietly, "China (Chinese: 中国; pinyin: Zhōngguó; lit. 'Central State; Middle Kingdom'), officially the People's Republic -"

"What's Republic?" a student questioned sullenly.

The professor acknowledged the question with a nod.

The lecturer declared carefully, "A republic (from Latin res publica 'public affair') is a form of government in which 'power is held by the people and their elected representatives'. In republics, the country is considered a 'public matter', not the private concern or property of the rulers. The primary positions of power within a republic are attained through democracy or a mix of democracy with oligarchy or autocracy rather than being unalterably occupied by any given family lineage or group. With modern republicanism, it has become the opposing form of government to a monarchy and therefore a modern republic has no monarch as head of state.As of 2017, 159 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word 'republic' as part of their official names. Not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor is the word 'republic' used in the names of all states with elected governments. The word republic comes from the Latin term res publica, which literally means 'public thing', 'public matter', or 'public affair' and was used to refer to the state as a whole. The term developed its modern meaning in reference to the constitution of the ancient Roman Republic, lasting from the overthrow of the kings in 509 BC to the establishment of the Empire -"

The lecturer took a breath, expecting a question from the pupils about Empire or some other topic.

The class sniggered.

The lecturer continued.

The instructor acknowledged the question with a clap of his hands.

The educator declared calmly, "The United States (U.S. or US -"

"What's US?" a student raised politely.

The professor acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The teacher declared patiently, "The United States (U.S. or US -"

"What's US?" a student said confidently.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a smirk.

The schoolteacher declared gingerly, "The United States (U.S. or US), officially the United States of America (U.S.A. or USA -"

"What's USA?" a girl quizzed patiently.

The professor acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The teacher paid no heed to the interruption and proceeded.

The schoolteacher seethed calmly, "- USA) and commonly known as America, is a country primarily located in North America. It consists of 50 states, a federal district, five major unincorporated territories, 326 Indian reservations -"

"What's Indian reservations?" a girl said gingerly.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The teacher sang sullenly, "An Indian reservation is an area of land tenure governed by a federally recognized Native American tribal nation under the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs -"

"What's Bureau of Indian Affairs?" a boy queried furiously.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a smirk.

The lecturer noted gingerly, "The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), also known as Indian Affairs (IA), is a United States federal agency within the Department of the Interior. It is responsible for implementing federal laws and policies related to American Indians and Alaska Natives, and administering and managing over 55,700,000 acres (225,000 km2) of land held in trust by the U.S. federal government for Indian Tribes. It renders services to roughly 2 million indigenous Americans across 574 federally recognized tribes. The BIA is governed by a director and overseen by the assistant secretary for Indian affairs, who answers to the secretary of the interior. The BIA works with tribal governments to help administer law enforcement and justice; promote development in agriculture, infrastructure, and the economy; enhance tribal governance; manage natural resources; and generally advance the quality of life in tribal communities. Educational services are provided by Bureau of Indian Education -"

"What's Bureau of Indian Education?" a student raised mechanically.

The educator acknowledged the query with a grin.

The instructor muttered timidly, "The Bureau of Indian Education (BIE), headquartered in the Main Interior Building -"

"What's Main Interior Building?" a pupil piped up aggressively.

The instructor ignored the interruption and carried on.

The instructor explained excitedly, "- Main Interior Building in Washington, D.C. -"

"What's Washington, D.C.?" a student quizzed carefully.

The teacher paid no attention to the interruption and carried on.

The schoolteacher announced, "- Washington, D.C., and formerly known as the Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP), is a division of the U.S. Department of the Interior under the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs. It is responsible for the line direction and management of all BIE education functions, including the formation of policies and procedures, the supervision of all program activities, and the approval of the expenditure of funds appropriated for BIE education functions.The BIE school system has 184 elementary and secondary schools and dormitories located on 63 reservations in 23 states, including seven off-reservation boarding schools, and 122 schools directly controlled by tribes and tribal school boards under contracts or grants with the BIE.

The instructor murmured carefully, "The American Football Conference (AFC) is one of the two conferences of the National Football League (NFL), the highest professional level of American football -"

"What's American football?" a student said quietly.

The professor acknowledged the question with a smile.

The lecturer seethed breathlessly, "American football, referred to simply as football in the United States and Canada and also known as gridiron, is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end. The offense, the team with possession of the oval-shaped football, attempts to advance down the field by running with the ball or passing it, while the defense, the team without possession of the ball, aims to stop the offense's advance and to take control of the ball for themselves. The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs or plays; if they fail, they turn over the football to the defense, but if they succeed, they are given a new set of four downs to continue the drive. Points are scored primarily by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal. The team with the most points at the end of a game wins. American football evolved in the United States, originating from the sports of soccer and rugby. The first American football match was played on November 6, 1869, between two college teams, Rutgers and Princeton, using rules based on the rules of soccer at the time. A set of rule changes drawn up from 1880 onward by Walter Camp -"

"What's Walter Camp?" a boy blurted breathlessly.

The professor acknowledged the query with a nervous laugh.

The educator seethed, "Walter Chauncey Camp (April 7, 1859 – March 14, 1925) was an American football -"

"What's American football?" a boy asked.

The instructor disregarded the interruption and proceeded.

The schoolteacher elaborated sullenly, "- American football player, coach, and sports writer known as the 'Father of American Football'. Among a long list of inventions, he created the sport's line of scrimmage and the system of downs. With John Heisman -"

"What's John Heisman?" a pupil asked sullenly.

The schoolteacher elaborated quietly, "- John Heisman, Amos Alonzo Stagg -"

The schoolteacher looked around, expecting a question from the students about Amos Alonzo Stagg or some other topic.

The students listened in rapt attention.

The teacher continued.

The lecturer breathed sullenly, "- Amos Alonzo Stagg, Pop Warner, Fielding H. Yost -"

"What's Fielding H. Yost?" a pupil questioned gingerly.

The instructor paid no attention to the interruption and carried on.

The professor announced crudely, "- Fielding H. Yost, and George Halas -"

The lecturer looked around, waiting for a query from the students about George Halas or some other topic.

The professor continued.

The teacher muttered confidently, "- George Halas, Camp was one of the most accomplished persons in the early history of American football. He attended Yale College, where he played and coached college football. Camp's Yale teams of 1888, 1891, and 1892 have been recognized as national champions. Camp was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame -"

"What's College Football Hall of Fame?" a boy piped up sadly.

The schoolteacher paid no attention to the interruption and proceeded.

The educator seethed pointedly, "- College Football Hall of Fame as a coach during 1951.Yale dominated college football in the 1880s and 1890s led by Camp. The 1888 team had a 14-0 record and was unscored on with total points of 704-0. The 1889 team earned a 15-1 record and defeated its opponents 665-31. Its only loss that season was to Princeton 10-0.Camp wrote articles and books on the gridiron and sports in general, annually publishing an 'All-American' team. By the time of his death, he had written nearly 30 books and more than 250 magazine articles. Camp was born in New Britain, Connecticut -"

The instructor paused, listening for a query from the class about New Britain, Connecticut or some other topic.

The pupils sat straighter in their seats.

The teacher continued.

The professor announced patiently, "- New Britain, Connecticut, the son of Leverett Camp and Ellen Sophia (Cornwell) Camp. Walter Camp was of English descent. His first immigrant ancestor was the English colonist Nicholas Camp, who came from Nazeing -"

"What's Nazeing?" a pupil interjected pointedly.

The instructor acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The teacher announced timidly, "Nazeing is a village and parish in Essex -"

"What's Essex?" a boy queried excitedly.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a slight jig.

The teacher explained pointedly, "Sex is a trait that determines an individual's reproductive function, male or female, in animals and plants that propagate their species through sexual reproduction. The type of gametes produced by an organism define its sex. Commonly in plants and animals, male organisms produce smaller gametes (spermatozoa, sperm) while female organisms produce larger gametes (ova, often called egg cells). Organisms that produce both types of gametes are called hermaphrodites. During sexual reproduction, male and female gametes fuse to form zygotes that develop into offspring that inherit a selection of the traits of each parent. Male -"

"What's Male?" a boy said gingerly.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a smile.

The schoolteacher paid no heed to the interruption and continued.

The instructor explained quickly, "- Males and females of a species may be similar (sexual monomorphism), or have physical differences (sexual dimorphism). The differences reflect the different reproductive pressures the sexes experience. For instance, mate choice and sexual selection can accelerate the evolution of physical differences between the sexes. The terms male and female typically do not apply in sexually undifferentiated species in which the individuals are isomorphic (look the same) and the gametes are isogamous (indistinguishable in size and shape), such as the green alga Ulva lactuca -"

The teacher halted, listening for a query from the class about Ulva lactuca or some other topic.

The class listened in rapt attention.

The instructor proceeded.

The professor sang carefully, "- Ulva lactuca. If there are instead functional differences between gametes, such as in fungi, they may be referred to as mating types.Sex is genetically determined in most mammals by the XY sex-determination system, where male mammals carry an X and a Y chromosome -"

"What's Y chromosome?" a student queried aggressively.

The lecturer acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The instructor announced robotically, "A chromosome is a long DNA -"

"What's DNA?" a boy wondered furiously.

The teacher acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The professor paid no attention to the interruption and carried on.

The teacher seethed sadly, "- DNA molecule with part or all of the genetic material of an organism. Most eukaryotic chromosomes include packaging proteins called histones which, aided by chaperone proteins, bind to and condense the DNA molecule to maintain its integrity. These chromosomes display a complex three-dimensional structure, which plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation.Chromosomes are normally visible under a light microscope only during the metaphase of cell division (where all chromosomes are aligned in the center of the cell in their condensed form). Before this happens, each chromosome is duplicated (S phase -"

The educator took a breath, listening for a query from the pupils about S phase or some other topic.

The lecturer continued.

The professor murmured mechanically, "- S phase), and both copies are joined by a centromere, resulting either in an X-shaped structure (pictured above), if the centromere is located equatorially, or a two-arm structure, if the centromere is located distally. The joined copies are now called sister chromatids. During metaphase the X-shaped structure is called a metaphase chromosome, which is highly condensed and thus easiest to distinguish and study. In animal cells, chromosomes reach their highest compaction level in anaphase during chromosome segregation.Chromosomal recombination during meiosis and subsequent sexual reproduction play a significant role in genetic diversity. If these structures are manipulated incorrectly, through processes known as chromosomal instability and translocation, the cell may undergo mitotic catastrophe. Usually, this will make the cell initiate apoptosis leading to its own death, but sometimes mutations in the cell hamper this process and thus cause progression of cancer. Some use the term chromosome in a wider sense, to refer to the individualized portions of chromatin in cells, either visible or not under light microscopy. Others use the concept in a narrower sense, to refer to the individualized portions of chromatin during cell division, visible under light microscopy due to high condensation. The word chromosome () comes from the Greek χρῶμα (chroma, 'colour') and σῶμα (soma, 'body'), describing their strong staining by particular dyes. The term was coined by the German anatomist Heinrich Wilhelm Waldeyer, referring to the term chromatin, which was introduced by Walther Flemming, the discoverer of cell division. Some of the early karyological terms have become outdated. For example, Chromatin -"

"What's Chromatin?" a girl questioned.

The professor acknowledged the question with a nod.

The teacher noted timidly, "Chromatin is a complex of DNA -"

"What's DNA?" a pupil quizzed excitedly.

The lecturer acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The lecturer ignored the interruption and continued.

The instructor sang timidly, "- DNA and protein found in eukaryotic cells. The primary function is to package long DNA molecules into more compact, denser structures. This prevents the strands from becoming tangled and also plays important roles in reinforcing the DNA during cell division preventing DNA damage and regulating gene expression and DNA replication -"

"What's DNA replication?" a pupil questioned sadly.

The educator acknowledged the question with a slight jig.

The professor said politely, "In molecular biology, DNA -"

"What's DNA?" a girl said quickly.

The educator ignored the interruption and proceeded.

The professor sang carefully, "- DNA replication is the biological process of producing two identical replicas of DNA from one original DNA molecule. DNA replication occurs in all living organisms acting as the most essential part for biological inheritance. This is essential for cell division during growth and repair of damaged tissues, while it also ensures that each of the new cells receives its own copy of the DNA. The cell possesses the distinctive property of division, which makes replication of DNA essential. DNA is made up of a double helix of two complementary strands. The double helix describes the appearance of a double-stranded DNA which is thus composed of two linear strands that run opposite to each other and twist together to form. During replication, these strands are separated. Each strand of the original DNA molecule then serves as a template for the production of its counterpart, a process referred to as semiconservative replication. As a result of semi-conservative replication, the new helix will be composed of an original DNA strand -"

"What's DNA strand?" a student questioned politely.

The teacher paid no heed to the interruption and carried on.

"Alright, back again to Chromatin....", the lecturer sang carefully.

The pupils suppressed giggles.

"Alright, back again to Chromosome....", the teacher sang timidly.

The students suppressed giggles.

"So, going back to Sex....", the schoolteacher explained quietly.

"Okay, going back to National Football League....", the schoolteacher murmured slowly.

The pupils stifled their yawns.

"Well then, back again to Sam Shade....", the instructor muttered carefully.

The pupils stifled their yawns.

The bell rang.

"That's all the time we have. I hope you learned something today," the lecturer muttered.

The class shuffled out of the room sadly.

The teacher paused, waiting for a query from the pupils about The New York Times or some other topic.

The schoolteacher continued.

The educator noted breathlessly, "- The New York Times columnist David Brooks in his 1996 article 'The Tragedy of SID'. He wrote: The sufferers of this malady, have jobs that give them high status but low income. They lunch on an expense account at The Palm, but dine at home on macaroni. All day long the phone-message slips pile up on their desks—calls from famous people seeking favors—but at night they realize the tub needs scrubbing, so it's down on the hands and knees with the Ajax.

"What's Meritocracy?" a girl queried sadly.

The professor acknowledged the query with a smirk.

The teacher declared confidently, "Meritocracy (merit, from Latin -"

The instructor acknowledged the question with a smile.

The educator declared mechanically, "The Philippines ( (listen); Filipino: Pilipinas), officially the Republic -"

"What's Republic?" a girl asked aggressively.

The professor acknowledged the query with a clap of his hands.

The instructor sang sadly, "A republic (from Latin res publica 'public affair') is a form of government in which 'power is held by the people and their elected representatives'. In republics, the country is considered a 'public matter', not the private concern or property of the rulers. The primary positions of power within a republic are attained through democracy or a mix of democracy with oligarchy or autocracy rather than being unalterably occupied by any given family lineage or group. With modern republicanism, it has become the opposing form of government to a monarchy and therefore a modern republic has no monarch as head of state.As of 2017, 159 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word 'republic' as part of their official names. Not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor is the word 'republic' used in the names of all states with elected governments. The word republic comes from the Latin term res publica, which literally means 'public thing', 'public matter', or 'public affair' and was used to refer to the state as a whole. The term developed its modern meaning in reference to the constitution of the ancient Roman Republic -"

"What's Roman Republic?" a boy questioned gingerly.

The period lasted for roughly 3.4 million years, and ended between 4,000 BCE and 2,000 BCE, with the advent of metalworking. Though some simple metalworking of malleable metals, particularly the use of gold and copper for purposes of ornamentation, was known in the Stone Age, it is the melting and smelting of copper that marks the end of the Stone Age.

The instructor looked around, anticipating a query from the class about Middle Ages or some other topic.

The students listened in rapt attention.

The instructor proceeded.

The instructor breathed carefully, "- Middle Ages predominantly by the nobility or royalty and by military orders. Scholars debate the scope of the word castle, but usually consider it to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble. This is distinct from a palace, which is not fortified; from a fortress, which was not always a residence for royalty or nobility; from a ‘pleasance’ which was a walled-in residence for nobility, but not adequately fortified; and from a fortified settlement, which was a public defence – though there are many similarities among these types of construction. Use of the term has varied over time and has been applied to structures as diverse as hill forts and country houses. Over the approximately 900 years that castles were built, they took on a great many forms with many different features, although some, such as curtain walls, arrowslits, and portcullises, were commonplace.

As in other languages, the word formation stems from the fact that west is the direction of the setting sun in the evening: 'west' derives from the Indo-European root *wes reduced from *wes-pero 'evening, night', cognate with Ancient Greek ἕσπερος hesperos 'evening; evening star; western' and Latin vesper 'evening; west'. Examples of the same formation in other languages include Latin occidens 'west' from occidō 'to go down, to set' and Hebrew מַעֲרָב maarav 'west' from עֶרֶב erev 'evening'. To go west using a compass for navigation (in a place where magnetic north is the same direction as true north) one needs to set a bearing or azimuth of 270°. West is the direction opposite that of the Earth -"
