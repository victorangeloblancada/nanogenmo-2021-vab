# NaNoGenMo 2021
This is the repository for my 2021 entry to NaNoGenMo (National Novel Generation Month).

Inspired by [this Abstruse Goose comic](https://abstrusegoose.com/98):

I have used the [Python wikipedia library](https://pypi.org/project/wikipedia/) to pull pages and links from Wikipedia. The lecture_loop() function in the "NLP Generator.py" file simulates a lecture from the contents of a Wikipedia article and generates questions based on links within the article.
